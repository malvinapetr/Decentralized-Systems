Surname: Atta
Awards: 10
Education: Khan was a Bright Sparks scholar and received his PhD degree in Computer Science from  University of Malaya . [14]  He received his master's degree and bachelor's degree (with honors) in Computer Science from  COMSATS University  under COMSATS scholarship. He has also attended a summer camp on Advance Wireless Networks at  Technische Universität Ilmenau  under  DAAD scholarship .

Surname: Aalst
Awards: 0
Education: Born in Eersel , Netherlands , van der Aalst received an MSc in computing science in 1988 at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e), and a PhD in mathematics in 1992 with the thesis "Timed colored Petri nets and their application to logistics" under supervision of Jaap Wessels and Kees van Hee . [2]

Surname: Aaronson
Awards: 4
Education: Aaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father—a  science writer  turned public-relations executive—was posted to Hong Kong. [2]  He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a  gifted education  program run by  Clarkson University , which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school. [2]  He was accepted into  Cornell University , where he obtained his BSc in  computer science  in 2000, [3]  and where he resided at the  Telluride House . [4]  He then attended the  University of California, Berkeley , for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of  Umesh Vazirani . [5] 
Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself  calculus  at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered  computer programming  at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly  computational complexity theory . At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and  quantum computing . [2]

Surname: Abebe
Awards: 3
Education: Abebe was born and raised in  Addis Ababa ,  Ethiopia . [5]  She was educated in the Ethiopian National Curriculum at Nazareth School before winning a competitive merit-based scholarship to attend the  International Community School of Addis Ababa  for high school. [5] 
Abebe attended  Harvard University  where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in  mathematics  and later a  Master of Science degree  in  applied mathematics . As an undergraduate, she co-authored research papers in mathematics, physics, and public health. [6] [7]  While at Harvard, Abebe contributed to  The Harvard Crimson  as a staff writer, where she focused on the Cambridge public school system (2009-2011). [8] 
After college, she attended the  University of Cambridge  as the Governor William Shirley Scholar at  Pembroke College . [9] [10]  She completed  Part III  of the  Mathematics Tripos  and earned a Master of Advanced Studies in  pure mathematics  under the supervision of  Imre Leader .
Abebe completed her doctoral degree in  computer science  at  Cornell University , where she was advised by  Jon Kleinberg . [11]  Her dissertation made notable contributions across multiple fields in computer science, receiving the 2020 ACM SIGKDD Dissertation Award and an honorable mention for the ACM SIGecom Dissertation Award. She is the first Black woman to complete a Ph.D. in computer science in the university's history. [12]

Surname: Abelson
Awards: 1
Education: Abelson graduated with a  Bachelor of Arts  degree in mathematics from  Princeton University  in 1969 after completing a senior thesis on  Actions with fixed-point set: a homology sphere , supervised by  William Browder . [1] 
 [7] 
He received his  PhD  in mathematics from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in 1973 after completing his research on  Topologically distinct conjugate varieties with finite fundamental group  supervised by  Dennis Sullivan . [8] [9]
