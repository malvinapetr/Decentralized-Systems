Surname: Bell
Awards: 8
Education: Gordon Bell was born in  Kirksville, Missouri . He grew up helping with the family business, Bell Electric, repairing appliances and wiring homes. [1] 
Bell received a  BS  (1956), and  MS  (1957) in  electrical engineering  from  MIT . He then went to the  New South Wales University of Technology  (now UNSW) in Australia on a  Fulbright Scholarship , where he taught classes on computer design, programmed one of the first computers to arrive in Australia (called UTECOM, an  English Electric DEUCE ), and published his first academic paper. Returning to the US, he worked in the MIT Speech Computation Laboratory under Professor  Ken Stevens , where he wrote the first  analysis by synthesis  program.
The  DEC  founders  Ken Olsen  and  Harlan Anderson  recruited him for their new company in 1960, where he designed the  I/O  subsystem of the  PDP-1 , including the first  UART .  Bell was the architect of the  PDP-4 , and  PDP-6 .  Other architectural contributions were to the  PDP-5  and  PDP-11   Unibus  and General Registers architecture. [2] 
After DEC, Bell went to  Carnegie Mellon University  in 1966 to teach  computer science , but returned to DEC in 1972 as vice-president of engineering, where he was in charge of the  VAX , DEC's most successful computer.
Bell retired from DEC in 1983 after a  heart attack , but soon after founded  Encore Computer , one of the first shared memory, multiple-microprocessor computers to use the  snooping cache  structure.
During the 1980s he became involved with public policy, becoming the first and founding Assistant Director of the  CISE  Directorate of the  NSF , and led the cross-agency group that specified the  NREN .
Bell also established the ACM  Gordon Bell Prize  (administered by the ACM and IEEE) in 1987 to encourage development in  parallel processing .  The first Gordon Bell Prize was won by researchers at the Parallel Processing Division of Sandia National Laboratory for work done on the 1000-processor  nCUBE 10   hypercube .
He was a founding member of  Ardent Computer  in 1986, becoming VP of R&D in 1988, and remained until it merged with  Stellar  in 1989, to become  Stardent Computer .
Between 1991 and 1995, Bell advised  Microsoft  in its efforts to start a research group, then joined it full-time in August 1995, studying  telepresence  and related ideas. He is the  experiment subject  for the  MyLifeBits  project, an experiment in  life-logging  (not the same as  life-blogging ). This is an attempt to fulfill  Vannevar Bush 's vision of an automated store of the documents, pictures (including those taken automatically), and sounds an individual has experienced in his lifetime, to be accessed with speed and ease. For this, Bell has digitized all documents he has read or produced, CDs, emails, and so on. He continues to do so, gathering web pages browsed, phone and instant messaging conversations and the like more or less automatically.
Bell was elected a member of the  National Academy of Engineering  in 1977 for contributions to the architecture of minicomputers. He is also a Fellow of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences  (1994), [3]   American Association for the Advancement of Science  (1983),  Association for Computing Machinery  (1994),  IEEE  (1974), and member of the  National Academy of Sciences  (2007), and Fellow of the  Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering  (2009).
He is also a member of the advisory board of  TTI/Vanguard  and a former member of the Sector Advisory Committee of Australia's Information and Communication Technology Division of the  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation .
Bell was the first recipient of the  IEEE John von Neumann Medal , in 1992. [4]   His other awards include Fellow of the  Computer History Museum , the  AeA  Inventor Award, the Vladimir Karapetoff Outstanding Technical Achievement Award of  Eta Kappa Nu , and the 1991  National Medal of Technology  by President  George H. W. Bush . [5]  He was also named an Eta Kappa Nu Eminent Member in 2007.
In 1993,  Worcester Polytechnic Institute  awarded Bell an Honorary Doctor of Engineering, and in 2010, Bell received an honorary Doctor of Science and Technology degree from  Carnegie Mellon University . The latter award referred to him as "the father of the minicomputer".
Bell co-founded  The Computer Museum  in Boston, Massachusetts, with his wife  Gwen Bell  in 1979. He was a founding board member of its successor, the  Computer History Museum  located in  Mountain View, California .  In 2003, he was made a Fellow of the Museum "for his key role in the minicomputer revolution, and for contributions as a computer architect and entrepreneur". [6]   The story of the museum's evolution beginning in the early 1970s with  Ken Olsen  at  Digital Equipment Corporation  is described in the Microsoft Technical Report MSR-TR-2011-44, "Out of a Closet: The Early Years of The Computer [x]* Museum". [7]  A timeline of computing historical machines, events, and people is given on his website. [8]  It covers from prehistoric times to the present.
Bell's law of computer classes [9]  was first described in 1972 with the emergence of a new, lower priced microcomputer class based on the microprocessor.  Established market class computers are introduced at a constant price with increasing functionality and performance.  Technology advances in semiconductors, storage, interfaces and networks enable a new computer class (platform) to form about every decade to serve a new need. Each new  usually lower priced  class is maintained as a quasi independent industry (market). Classes include: mainframes (1960s), minicomputers (1970s), networked workstations and personal computers (1980s), browser-web-server structure (1990s), palmtop computing (1995), web services (2000s), convergence of cell phones and computers (2003), and Wireless Sensor Networks aka motes [ clarification needed ]  (2004). Bell predicted that home and body area networks would form by 2010.

Awards: 1
Education: Brandenburg received a Dipl. Ing. degree from Erlangen University in Electrical Engineering (1980) as well as a Dipl. Math. degree in Mathematics (1982). In 1989, he obtained his PhD from the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg in Electrical Engineering for his work on digital audio coding and perceptual measurement techniques. 
Brandenburg's PhD advisor was Professor Dieter Seitzer, an expert in psychoacoustics. In the early 1980s, Seitzer had a pet project that he called a "digital jukebox." He envisioned a system where people could connect to a central server and hear music on demand over ISDN phone lines. But the bandwidth of ISDN is an order of magnitude too narrow for transmission of CD-quality digital audio. A standard compact disc uses linear pulse code modulation (PCM) with 16 bits per sample per channel, at 44,100 samples per second. This means that it takes about 1.4 million bits to encode a single second of stereo audio. To send music over ISDN at playback speed, Seitzer would need to compress the file down by a factor of almost 12-to-1.

Surname: Brin
Awards: 5
Education: Sergey Mikhailovich Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow in the  Soviet Union , [4]  to  Russian Jewish  parents, [5]  Mikhail and Eugenia Brin, both graduates of  Moscow State University  (MSU). [6]  His father is a retired mathematics professor at the  University of Maryland , and his mother is a researcher at  NASA 's  Goddard Space Flight Center . [7] [8] 
The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother. [7]  In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in  Warsaw , Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. [7]  They formally applied for their  exit visa  in September 1978, and as a result, his father was "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many  refuseniks . In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country. [7] 
The Brin family lived in  Vienna  and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the  University of Maryland  with help from  Anatole Katok . During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the  Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society . They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979. [7] [9] 
Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch  Montessori School  in  Adelphi, Maryland , but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the  University of Maryland , encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended  Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Maryland . In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the  University of Maryland , where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19. [10]  In 1993, he interned at  Wolfram Research , the developers of  Mathematica . [10] 
Brin began his graduate study in computer science at  Stanford University  on a  graduate fellowship  from the  National Science Foundation , receiving an M.S. in computer science in 1995. [11]  As of 2008 [update] , he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford. [12]

In 1984, Brown was introduced to  David Wheeler , who invited him to join the  University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory  as a doctoral candidate. In October 1986, he matriculated at  St John's College ,  University of Cambridge ,  England  to pursue a  Ph.D.  degree. His dissertation introduced the concept of  Unified Memory Architecture . [2]  This idea has subsequently been widely applied — such as by  Intel  in their processors and platform architecture of the late 1990s and onward. [2]

Surname: Brinch
Awards: 1
Education: Per Brinch Hansen was born in  Frederiksberg , an enclave surrounded by  Copenhagen ,  Denmark . His father,  Jørgen Brinch Hansen , worked as a civil engineer, becoming a leading expert in soil mechanics, and later accepting a professorship at  Technical University of Denmark . His mother, Elsebeth Brinch Hansen (née Ring), was the daughter of Danish composer  Oluf Ring  and worked as a hairdresser before marrying. [1] 
Brinch Hansen attended  Skt. Jørgens Gymnasium  and then studied electrical engineering at Technical University of Denmark where he sought an area to pursue that "was still in its pioneering phase" on the belief that "If a subject was being taught, it was probably already too late to make fundamental contributions." [1] [2]  After a seven-week student internship at  IBM 's Hursley Laboratory in England, he decided to dedicate his career to computers. Initially focused on computer construction, reading a book on the  IBM 7030 Stretch  project that described computer organization from a programmer's point of view [3]  refocused his interest toward becoming a computer architect. [1] 
After completing a  Master of Science  degree in  electronic engineering  in 1963, Brinch Hansen landed a job at  Regnecentralen , then a research institution under The Danish Academy of Technical Sciences (Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber), working in the compiler group, led by  Peter Naur  and  Jørn Jensen . [2]  There, his first significant project was writing a  parser  for a  COBOL   compiler  for the  Siemens  3003 computer.
Subsequently, he wrote a  file system  to be used during  execution  of the compiled COBOL programs, later observing: [1] 
I now understand that it was really a small operating system, I had programmed. However, in the mid 1960s, the dividing line between language implementation and operating systems was still not clearly understood.In 1966, Brinch Hansen moved to Henning Isaksson's hardware group at Regnecentralen, by then a company with shareholders. Together with Peter Kraft, he defined the  computer architecture  and  instruction set  for Regnecentralen's third computer, the RC 4000, using  ALGOL 60  as a  hardware description language  to produce a  formal specification .
Inexperienced with  multiprogramming , he used a copy of  Cooperating Sequential Processes [4]   Edsger Dijkstra  had sent him to understand  process synchronization  using  semaphores , and then implemented a specialized RC 4000  real-time   monitor  for use in managing a fertilizer plant. Peter Kraft and  Charles Simonyi , who was still a teenager, wrote a  p-code   interpreter  and data logging task programs that were compiled to p-code. [1] 
In the summer of 1967, Brinch Hansen left Regnecentralen's hardware group to become head of RC 4000  software development , where he led a team including Jørn Jensen, Peter Kraft and Søren Lauesen in defining a general-purpose  RC 4000 multiprogramming system , with a goal to avoid developing a custom  real-time control  operating system for every RC 4000 installation, and to support  batch processing  and  time-sharing  as well. [1]  The resulting system was not a complete operating system, but a small  kernel  providing the mechanisms upon which operating systems for different purposes could be built. [5]  By the spring of 1969, a well-documented, reliable version of the RC 4000 multiprogramming system was running. [1] 
In late 1970, Brinch Hansen moved to  Pittsburgh , accepting an invitation from  Alan Perlis  to visit the department of  computer science  at  Carnegie Mellon University  as a research associate, while he wrote the first systematic textbook on operating system principles. [1] [2]  During this time, at the 1971  Summer School in Marktoberdorf  and a symposium in  Belfast , Brinch Hansen,  Tony Hoare  and Dijkstra began to discuss ideas that evolved into the  monitor  concept. In the spring of 1972, after reading about the  class  concept invented by  Ole-Johan Dahl  and  Kristen Nygaard  for  Simula  67, Brinch Hansen completed his text with a chapter on resource protection that proposed the first monitor notation, using shared classes. [6]  In 1973,  Operating System Principles  was published, becoming the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems. [7] 
In July 1972, Brinch Hansen joined the faculty of the  California Institute of Technology  (Caltech) as an Associate Professor of computer science, where he began work on defining a  programming language  with concurrent processes and monitors. In April 1974, he distributed a technical report on  Concurrent Pascal . [1] [2]  A Concurrent Pascal  compiler  for the  PDP 11/45 , written by Brinch Hansen's doctoral student, Al Hartmann, was released in January 1975. [8]  Subsequently, Brinch Hansen began writing model operating systems in Concurrent Pascal, to evaluate the language. In May 1975, he completed Solo, a single-user operating system for development of Concurrent Pascal programs. Next, he rewrote the original RC 4000 real-time scheduler in Concurrent Pascal, taking three days to write it, and three hours of machine time to systematically test it. [6] 
When the Caltech computer science department shifted focus toward computer engineering and away from programming Brinch Hansen decided to leave, rather than to seek tenure there. [1] 
In 1976, Brinch Hansen chose  University of Southern California  (USC) for his next post, so that his family could remain in their  Altadena  home. Joining the faculty as a tenured full professor, and first chair of a newly created computer science department, he led efforts to identify and attract top-notch faculty to build a first rate department. By 1980, USC's computer science department was ranked by the  National Research Council  as one of the top ten in the US. [1] 
While at USC, Brinch Hansen wrote his second book,  The Architecture of Concurrent Programs,  based on his work developing operating systems with Concurrent Pascal. [2]  Published in 1977, it was the first book on concurrent programming. [9]  In 1978, Brinch Hansen became the first computer scientist awarded the Doctor Technices degree, the highest academic distinction within engineering and technological science in Denmark, [10]  for the work documented in  The Architecture of Concurrent Programs . Later in 1978, Brinch Hansen published the Distributed Processes language concept, proposing the use of  remote procedure calls  to synchronize processes running across a microcomputer network. [11] 
Also in 1978, L. J. Sevins and Steve Goings from  Mostek  visited Brinch Hansen at USC, where he outlined a low-cost  multiprocessor  architecture. Mostek began a project to implement such a multiprocessor, with Brinch Hansen working as a consultant. [1]  Brinch Hansen developed a new concurrent programming language, Edison, for the project. [12]  As with the RC 4000 project, Edison was also used as a formal specification language for the hardware. Mostek got an initial 4-node multiprocessor working and Brinch Hansen wrote a portable Edison compiler on a PDP 11/55, but shortly after,  United Technologies  acquired Mostek [13]  and cancelled the project. In 1982, Brinch Hansen moved the Edison system to an  IBM Personal Computer  (PC), and then published his third book,  Programming a Personal Computer . [14] 
In 1982, Brinch Hansen was named the first Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer Science at USC. [1] 
In 1984, feeling homesick for Denmark after 14 years abroad, Brinch Hansen left USC and joined the faculty of the  University of Copenhagen  as a Professor of  datalogy . [1]  In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE). [15]  Later in 1985, his fourth book  Brinch Hansen on  Pascal  Compilers , which he used for his own compiler course, was published. [16] 
While designing a  multicomputer  operating system for Danish company GN Elmi, Brinch Hansen concluded he needed a new language, this time leveraging the message passing paradigm of Hoare's  CSP . [1]  The resulting language,  Joyce , removed a major limitation of CSP by introducing parallel  recursion . [17]  Brinch Hansen developed a portable implementation on an IBM PC. [1] 
After finding that neither he nor his family felt at home in Denmark, Brinch Hansen decided to return to the US, but discovered that their immigration status required them to do so very quickly. Brinch Hansen contacted  John Reynolds  at  Syracuse University  and in 1987 he joined the faculty as a Distinguished Professor. [1] 
Working with his student Rangachari Anand, Joyce was moved to an  Encore Multimax 320  multiprocessor at SU's Northeast Parallel Architectures Center. Recognizing the scaling limitations of multiprocessors, however, Brinch Hansen sought a suitable multicomputer for further work. Acquiring a  Meiko Computing Surface  in 1989, he began experimenting with scientific applications by developing parallel programs for  Householder's method  (reduction) and then  n-body simulation  as learning exercises, and was surprised to find that both programs had nearly identical control structures. Concluding that both fit an "all-pairs paradigm," he then focused on exploring reusable parallel algorithm structures he termed "programming paradigms" or "generic programs" (later, popularly known as " design patterns "). [1]  In 1995, Brinch Hansen's fifth book,  Studies in Computational Science: Parallel Programming Paradigms  was published, [18]  with programs rewritten in  SuperPascal , a fully implemented publication language he created for parallel algorithms. [19] 
In his later years, Brinch Hansen published a retrospective of his most important papers,  The Search for Simplicity  (1996), [20]  a text for a course in programming for non-majors,  Programming for Everyone in Java  (1999), [21]  a retrospective on the evolution of operating systems,  Classic Operating Systems: From Batch Processing to Distributed Systems  (2001), [22]  and a retrospective on the evolution of concurrent programming,  The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls  (2002). [23]  He self-published a 2004 memoir,  A Programmer's Story: The Life of a Computer Pioneer , on his website. [1] 
In 2002, Brinch Hansen was awarded the  IEEE Computer Pioneer Award  "For pioneering development in operating systems and concurrent programming exemplified by work on the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, monitors, and Concurrent Pascal." [15] 
On July 31, 2007, Brinch Hansen died, shortly after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. [24]

Education: Diffie was born in  Washington, D.C. , the son of Justine Louise (Whitfield), a writer and scholar, and  Bailey Wallys Diffie , who taught  Iberian  history and culture at  City College of New York . [8]  His interest in cryptography began at "age 10 when his father, a professor, brought home the entire crypto shelf of the City College Library in New York." [8] 
At  Jamaica High School  in  Queens, New York , Diffie "performed competently" but "never did apply himself to the degree his father hoped." Although he graduated with a local diploma, he did not take the statewide Regents examinations that would have awarded him an academic diploma because he had previously secured admission to  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  on the basis of "stratospheric scores on standardized tests." [9]  While he received a  B.S.  in  mathematics  from the institution in 1965, he remained unengaged and seriously considered transferring to the  University of California, Berkeley  (which he perceived as a more hospitable academic environment) during the first two years of his undergraduate studies. At MIT, he began to program computers (in an effort to cultivate a practical skill set) while continuing to perceive the devices "as very low class... I thought of myself as a pure mathematician and was very interested in  partial differential equations  and  topology  and things like that." [9]

Education: Before the  Civil Rights Movement , educational and career opportunities for African-American children were  very limited .  Segregation  was prevalent, African-American children were educated separately from white children, and their schools were often inferior to white schools. Annie's mother told her that she could be anything, but she would have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good education. From the fifth grade through high school, Annie attended  Holy Family High School , and was  valedictorian  of her graduating class. [5]  At a young age Annie had interest in becoming a nurse, but around the age of 16 she decided to study pharmacy. [6] 
In 1950, Easley enrolled in classes at  Xavier University  in  New Orleans , [3]  an African-American Catholic university, and majored in  pharmacy  for about two years. [5] 
In 1977, she obtained a  Bachelor of Science  in  Mathematics  from  Cleveland State University . [7] [8]

Surname: Engelbart
Awards: 7
Education: Engelbart was born in  Portland, Oregon , on January 30, 1925, to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson Engelbart. His ancestors were of  German ,  Swedish  and  Norwegian  descent. [7] 
He was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (three years older), and a brother David (14 months younger). The family lived in Portland, Oregon, in his early years, and moved to the surrounding countryside along Johnson Creek when he was 8. His father died one year later. He graduated from Portland's  Franklin High School  in 1942. [8] 
Midway through his undergraduate years at  Oregon State University , he served two years in the  United States Navy  as a radio and  radar  technician in the  Philippines . [8]  It was there, on the remote island of   Leyte  in a small traditional hut on stilts, that he read  Vannevar Bush 's article " As We May Think ", which would have a large influence on his thinking and work. [9]  He returned to Oregon State and completed his bachelor's degree in  electrical engineering  in 1948. While at Oregon State, he was a member of  Sigma Phi Epsilon  social fraternity. [10] [11]  He was hired by the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  at the  Ames Research Center , where he worked in wind tunnel maintenance. In his off hours he enjoyed hiking, camping, and folk dancing. It was there he met Ballard Fish (August 18, 1928 – June 18, 1997), [12]  who was just completing her training to become an occupational therapist. They were married in  Portola State Park  on May 5, 1951. Soon after, Engelbart left Ames to pursue graduate studies at the  University of California, Berkeley . At Berkeley, he studied electrical engineering with a specialty in computers, earning his  MS  in 1953 and his  PhD  in 1955. [13] 
Engelbart's career was inspired in December 1950 when he was engaged to be married and realized he had no career goals other than "a steady job, getting married and living happily ever after". [15]  Over several months he reasoned that:
In 1945, Engelbart had read with interest Vannevar Bush's article "As We May Think", [17]  a call to action for making knowledge widely available as a national peacetime grand challenge. He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display "working stations", flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools. [18] 
As a graduate student at Berkeley, he assisted in the construction of  CALDIC . His graduate work led to eight patents. [19]  After completing his doctorate, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an  assistant professor  for a year before departing when it became clear that he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, to commercialize some of his doctoral research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951. [20] 
Engelbart took a position at  SRI International  (known then as Stanford Research Institute) in  Menlo Park, California  in 1957. He worked for  Hewitt Crane  on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics; Engelbart and Crane became close friends. [21]  At SRI, Engelbart soon obtained a dozen patents, [19]  and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed research agenda titled  Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework . [18]  Among other highlights, this paper introduced " Building Information Modelling ", which architectural and engineering practice eventually adopted (first as " parametric design ") in the 1990s and after. [22] 
This led to funding from ARPA to launch his work. Engelbart recruited a research team in his new  Augmentation Research Center  (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI). Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed " bootstrapping  strategy". He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab. [23] [24] [25] 
The ARC became the driving force behind the design and development of the  oN-Line System  (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as  bitmapped  screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. [26]  He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see  batch processing ), and when software tended to be written for  vertical applications  in proprietary systems.
Engelbart applied for a  patent  in 1967 and received it in 1970, for the wooden shell with two metal wheels ( computer mouse  –  U.S. Patent 3,541,541 ), which he had developed with Bill English, his lead engineer, sometime before 1965. [27] [28]  In the patent application it is described as an "X-Y position indicator for a display system". Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the "mouse" because the tail came out the end. His group also called the on-screen  Cursor  a "bug", but this term was not widely adopted. [29]  Engelbart's original cursor was displayed as an arrow pointing upward, but was slanted to the left upon its deployment in the XEROX PARC machine to better distinguish between on-screen text and the cursor in the machine's low-resolution interface. [30]  The now-familiar cursor arrow is characterized by a vertical left side and a 45-degree angle on the right.
He never received any royalties for the invention of the mouse. During an interview, he said, "SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to  Apple Computer  for something like $40,000." [31]  Engelbart showcased the  chorded keyboard  and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at  The Mother of All Demos . [32] [33] 
Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity by the mid-1970s. As early as 1970, several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for  Xerox PARC , in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. [1]  Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked,  timeshare  (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the  personal computer . The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon. [1] [15] 
Beginning in 1972, several key ARC personnel were involved in  Erhard Seminars Training  (EST), with Engelbart ultimately serving on the corporation's board of directors for many years. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community. [34]  The 1969  Mansfield Amendment , which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the  Vietnam War , and the end of the  Apollo program  gradually reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and  NASA  throughout the early 1970s.
SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of  artificial intelligence  researcher  Bertram Raphael , who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to Tymshare in 1976. Engelbart's house in  Atherton, California  burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff (including its creator as a Senior Scientist), renamed the software  Augment , and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC. [15] 
At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself further marginalized. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to conduct ongoing research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. [35]  Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure. [1] [15] 
Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, he founded the Bootstrap Institute in 1988 to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University from 1989 to 2000. [15]  By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT), [36]  while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.
Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, which he founded in 1988 with his daughter Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic  bootstrapping  approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal. [37]  In 2005, Engelbart received a  National Science Foundation  grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. [38]  The Hyperscope team built a browser component using  Ajax  and  Dynamic HTML  designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents). [39] 
Engelbart attended the Program for the Future 2010 Conference where hundreds of people convened at The Tech Museum in San Jose and online to engage in dialog about how to pursue his vision to augment  collective intelligence . [40] 
The most complete coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping ideas can be found in  Boosting Our Collective IQ , by Douglas C. Engelbart, 1995. [41]  This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by  Yuri Rubinsky  and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and  Tim Berners-Lee . Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute. [42] 
Two comprehensive histories of Engelbart's laboratory and work are in  What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry  by  John Markoff  and  A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century  by Donald Neilson. [43]  Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include  Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing  by  Thierry Bardini  and  The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart , by  Valerie Landau  and  Eileen Clegg  in conversation with Douglas Engelbart. [44]  All four of these books are based on interviews with Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.
Engelbart served on the Advisory Boards of the  University of Santa Clara Center for Science, Technology, and Society ,  Foresight Institute , [45]   Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility , The Technology Center of Silicon Valley, and The Liquid Information Company. [46] 
Engelbart had four children, Gerda, Diana, Christina and Norman with his first wife Ballard, who died in 1997 after 47 years of marriage. He remarried on January 26, 2008, to writer and producer Karen O'Leary Engelbart. [47] [48]  An 85th birthday celebration was held at  the Tech Museum of Innovation . [49]  Engelbart died at his home in Atherton, California, on July 2, 2013, due to  kidney failure . [50] [51]  A close friend and fellow internet pioneer,  Ted Nelson , gave a speech paying tribute to Engelbart. [52]  According to the Doug Engelbart Institute, his death came after a long battle with  Alzheimer's disease , which he was diagnosed with in 2007. [20] [53]  Engelbart was 88 and was survived by his second wife, the four children from his first marriage, and nine grandchildren. [53] 
Historian of science Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex personal philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of  coevolution  to the philosophy and use of technology. [34]  Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the  principle of linguistic relativity  developed by  Benjamin Lee Whorf . Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work. [34] 
Since the late 1980s, prominent individuals and organizations have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions. [54]  In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in  Boston , he was the first recipient of what would later become the  Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award . In 1997, he was awarded the  Lemelson-MIT Prize  of $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and innovation, and the ACM  Turing Award . [1]  To mark the 30th anniversary of Engelbart's 1968 demo, in 1998 the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives and the  Institute for the Future  hosted  Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution , a  symposium  at  Stanford University 's Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas. [55]  He was inducted into  National Inventors Hall of Fame  in 1998. [56] 
Engelbart was awarded the Stibitz-Wilson Award from the  American Computer & Robotics Museum  in 1998. [57] 
Also in 1998,  Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM)  SIGCHI  awarded Engelbart the CHI Lifetime Achievement Award. [58]  ACM SIGCHI later inducted Engelbart into the  CHI Academy  in 2002. [58]  Engelbart was awarded  The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit  in 1996 and the  Benjamin Franklin Medal  in 1999 in Computer and Cognitive Science. In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with volunteers and sponsors, what was called  The Unfinished Revolution – II , also known as the  Engelbart Colloquium  at Stanford University, to document and publicize his work and ideas to a larger audience (live, and online). [59] [60] 
In December 2000, U.S. President  Bill Clinton  awarded Engelbart the  National Medal of Technology , the country's highest technology award. [45]  In 2001 he was awarded the  British Computer Society 's  Lovelace Medal . [61]  In 2005, he was made a Fellow of the  Computer History Museum  "for advancing the study of human–computer interaction, developing the mouse input device, and for the application of computers to improving organizational efficiency." [2]  He was honored with the  Norbert Wiener Award , which is given annually by  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility . [62]   Robert X. Cringely  did an hour-long interview with Engelbart on December 9, 2005, in his  NerdTV  video podcast series. [63] 
On December 9, 2008, Engelbart was honored at the 40th Anniversary celebration of the 1968 " Mother of All Demos ". [64]  This event, produced by SRI International, was held at Memorial Auditorium at Stanford University. Speakers included several members of Engelbart's original Augmentation Research Center (ARC) team including Don Andrews, Bill Paxton, Bill English, and  Jeff Rulifson , Engelbart's chief government sponsor  Bob Taylor , and other pioneers of interactive computing, including  Andy van Dam  and  Alan Kay . In addition, Christina Engelbart spoke about her father's early influences and the ongoing work of the Doug Engelbart Institute. [64] 
In June 2009, the  New Media Consortium  recognized Engelbart as an NMC Fellow for his lifetime of achievements. [65]  In 2011, Engelbart was inducted into  IEEE Intelligent Systems ' AI's Hall of Fame. [66]  Engelbart received the first  honorary  Doctor of Engineering and Technology degree from  Yale University  in May 2011. [67] [68] [69]

Education: Fredkin's mother and father were both Russian immigrants who met in Los Angeles, and he was the youngest child of four. His mother was a concert pianist, although she did not perform professionally. She died from cancer when he was 11. His father was a businessperson but had lost everything in the  1929 stock market crash  and as a result, the family was relatively poor. At times he lived with other families or with his older sister. Eventually, his father remarried, and he and his sister moved back in. As a child, he was both entrepreneurial and interested in science and how things work. He did various weekend and after-school things to earn money, eventually handling a large newspaper delivery route. At age 10 he bought chemistry supplies and made his own fireworks, which were then illegal in Los Angeles. He did poorly in school because he didn't do homework. He graduated from  John Marshall High School  a semester early so that he could earn money for Caltech tuition and living expenses. Caltech later told him he had been admitted with the worst high school grades they had ever seen. He quit Caltech partway through his sophomore year. [4]

Surname: Fu
Awards: 1
Education: Ping Fu was born in 1958 in  Nanjing ,  China , [6] [7]  where her father was a professor at the  Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics  (NUAA). [8]  Fu spent her childhood and early adulthood in China. She grew up during the  Cultural Revolution , during which she was separated from both her parents for several years. [9] [10]  After the end of the Cultural Revolution, she attended the college that later became the  Suzhou University [7] [11]  studying Chinese literature. [12]  Fu has related in interviews and in her memoir that she chose to research China's  one-child policy  for her thesis and traveled to the countryside, where she found that  infanticide  of female infants was common, as was abortion, even late into pregnancy. [13] [14]   Fu said that, after turning in her research, she believes it was passed to a newspaper editor who wrote an editorial on the infanticide of female children. [11] [15] [ better source needed ]  Fu has stated that she was later briefly imprisoned by government officials and was told to leave the country. [16] [17]  After this event, she left school, without graduating. [18] 
Fu left China and arrived in the United States in January 1984. [10]  She initially enrolled at the  University of New Mexico  (UNM) in  Albuquerque [15]  but later moved to  San Diego  to study computer science as an undergraduate at the  University of California, San Diego . [7]  During her time in  San Diego , Fu worked part-time at a software company called Resource Systems Group as a programmer and database software consultant. [19]  Following her graduation from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in computer science, she moved to Illinois, where she took a job with  Bell Labs . [7]  The company offered a Ph.D assistance program, through which Fu enrolled in the computer science Ph.D program at the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  (UIUC). At UIUC she completed a master's degree in computer science. [20] [21] 
In the early 1990s, Fu began working at the  National Center for Supercomputing Applications  (NCSA) at UIUC. [9] [10]  Her focus was on computer graphics and visualization, [21]  including projects such as developing the morphing software for animation of the liquid metal  T-1000  robot in the film  Terminator 2: Judgment Day . [13]  While at NCSA, she hired student researcher  Marc Andreessen  and was his supervisor on the project developing NCSA's  Mosaic , an early multimedia web browser credited with popularizing the  World Wide Web . [13] [22]  According to her supervisor, Joseph Hardin, Fu was one of the managers involved in the discussions from which the idea for the browser was developed. [22]  In 1994 Ping took a temporary position at the  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , returning to NCSA in 1995. [23] 
In 1996, Marc Andreessen's success with his own company,  Netscape , inspired UIUC to encourage entrepreneurship and Fu developed the idea for a company that would combine manufacturing and digital technology, including  3D modeling  software, the concept of which she called the "Personal Factory". [24]  She founded  Geomagic  with her then-husband,  Herbert Edelsbrunner , whose research formed the basis for the initial software to be developed by the company. In 1997, she left the NCSA to begin operations at Geomagic, taking on the role of CEO. [6] [10]  The company was originally named Raindrop Geomagic [10]  and was based in  Champaign-Urbana, Illinois . [7]  It was founded with the aim of developing 3D imaging software that could enable customized manufacturing using 3D printers. [15]  Initially, Fu and Edelsbrunner funded Geomagic themselves, along with investment from Fu's sister Hong and her husband, and later from a group of  angel investors . [7] 
In 1999, Fu relocated Geomagic from Illinois to the  Research Triangle Park ,  North Carolina . That year, Franklin Street Partners committed to invest $6.5 million in Geomagic. [7]  Fu then hired an experienced executive as CEO who ran Geomagic for two years before stepping down when the company was close to bankruptcy. [15]  Fu returned to the role of CEO in 2001, investing her own money into Geomagic and working without a salary in order to continue paying the company's employees. She was able to lead Geomagic back to stability, gaining a significant contract with  Align Technology , and Geomagic returned to profitability over the following two years. [10] 
From 2001 to 2003, Geomagic's sales tripled under Fu's leadership. [10]  The company became known as a leader in  digital shape sampling and processing . [7] [25] [26]  After she and Edelsbrunner divorced, [27]  he continued to serve as an advisor at Geomagic. [28] 
In February 2013, Fu sold Geomagic to  3D Systems Corporation , a 3D printing company. She became the Chief Strategy Officer and Vice-President of 3D Systems. [2] [3] [29] [30] 
In addition to leading Geomagic, Fu has held a number of advisory roles relating to technology and entrepreneurship and with charitable organizations. She has served on the U.S. National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship since 2010 and is also a member of the National Council on Women in Technology. [31]  In 2012, she was appointed to the board of the  Long Now Foundation , a non-profit organization focused on long-term thinking and enduring technology. [32]  She also serves on the board of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the  University of North Carolina , [33]  the board of  Live Nation Entertainment [34]  and is an advisor at Modern Meadow, an organization focused on tissue engineering. [35] 
On December 31, 2012, Fu published a memoir,  Bend, Not Break: A Life in Two Worlds . [36]  Co-authored with MeiMei Fox, the book told the stories of her life, from her early childhood in China to her experiences as an entrepreneur, including founding and leading Geomagic. [37] [38]  The book received positive reviews from outlets including  The Wall Street Journal [17]  and Oprah.com. [37] 
Beginning in January 2013, commentors in the Amazon.com reviews for the memoir began posting critical reviews, accusing Fu of lying about events in her past. [17]  Around the same time, first in English, [15]   then in Chinese  [39]  on  Forbes China ,  Forbes  published an interview with Fu that discussed Fu's memoir and her early life, which contained an inaccurate interpretation of where Ping Fu lived during the cultural revolution. [40] [41] [42]  Chinese  netizens  responded to the piece with criticisms regarding alleged fabrication of events and inconsistencies in media coverage of Fu, [40] [43]  which raised questions in the media about the veracity of details included in the memoir. [44]  Chinese blogger  Fang Zhouzi  was among the critics [45]  and he later raised further questions and criticisms based on earlier media coverage of Fu. [43]  Following the initial criticisms from Fang Zhouzi and other critics, commentors appearing to be non-native English speakers knowledgeable about Chinese history posted hundreds of negative comments in the memoir's Amazon.com reviews, leading  The Daily Beast  and  New York Times   [46]   to conclude that Ping was the subject of an  online attack . [17] [47] 
Fu responded to the criticisms through a public statement, [48]  and a post on the  Huffington Post  website answering questions that were raised about her childhood, education and being forced to leave China. [11]  She acknowledged that there were some inaccuracies in the book. [27]  She also acknowledged that the Red Guard atrocity she related in the memoir and media interviews regarding a teacher being pulled apart by four horses may have been an emotional memory, the result of hearing tales of such barbarity in old China as a child and having nightmares about it, or seeing it in a movie, rather than actually seeing it. [42] [49] [50]  In response to questions about accuracy of details in the book, her publisher stated that the book is a memoir, rather than a journalistic account of the Cultural Revolution. [45] [49]  Fu has said that a second print of the memoir will correct inaccuracies that have been pointed out. [50] 
For her work with Geomagic, Fu has received a number of awards. In 2003 she was named the  Ernst & Young  "Entrepreneur of the Year" for the Carolinas and received the Entrepreneurial Inspiration Award from North Carolina's Council for Entrepreneurial Development. [10]  The following year,  Fast Company  named her a 2004 "Fast 50" winner. [10] [51]  In 2005,  Inc.  magazine named Ping its "Entrepreneur of the Year". [8] 
The America China Business Women’s Alliance awarded Fu its "Business Innovation Award" in 2008 [52]  and she received the 2010 "Leadership Award" from the CAD Society. [51]  The next year, she was given a "Lifetime Achievement" award by the  Triangle Business Journal . [6]  In 2011 she was given the William C. Friday Award at North Carolina State University, [53]  and in 2012, the  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  named Fu as an "Outstanding American by Choice". [31]

Surname: Gates
Awards: 4
Education: William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington [3]  as the only son of  William H. Gates Sr. [b]  (1925–2020) and his first wife,  Mary Maxwell Gates  (1929–1994). [23]  His ancestry includes  English ,  German , and Irish/ Scots-Irish . [24]  His father was a prominent  lawyer , and his mother served on the board of directors of  First Interstate BancSystem  and  United Way of America . Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix. [25] [26]  The family lived in the  Sand Point  area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare  tornado  when Gates was seven years old. [27] 
According to Gates, when he was young, his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law. [28]  During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the  Congregational Christian Churches , a Protestant Reformed denomination. [29] [30] [31]  Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child. [26]  The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was  hearts  or  pickleball  or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing". [32] 
At age 13, he enrolled in the private  Lakeside prep school , [33] [34]  where he wrote his first software program. [35]  When he was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a  Teletype Model 33  ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a  General Electric  (GE) computer for the students. [36]  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in  BASIC , and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of  tic-tac-toe  that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. [37]  After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including  DEC   PDP  minicomputers. One of these systems was a  PDP-10  belonging to  Computer Center Corporation  (CCC) which banned Gates,  Paul Allen ,  Ric Weiland , and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time. [38] [26] 
The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money. [26]  At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via  Teletype , Gates went to CCC's offices and studied  source code  for various programs that ran on the system, including  Fortran ,  Lisp , and  machine language . The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.
The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside. [26] 
At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called  Traf-O-Data  to make traffic counters based on the  Intel 8008  processor. [39]  In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives. [40] [41]  He was a  National Merit Scholar  when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. [42]  He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the  Scholastic Aptitude Tests  (SAT) and enrolled at  Harvard College  in the autumn of 1973. [43] [44]  He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics (including  Math 55 ) and graduate level computer science courses. [45]  While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO  Steve Ballmer . Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated  magna cum laude . Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014. [46] [47] 
Gates devised an algorithm for  pancake sorting  as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems [48]  presented in a  combinatorics  class by professor  Harry Lewis . His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by only 2%. [48] [49]  His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist  Christos Papadimitriou . [50] 
Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at  Honeywell  during the summer of 1974. [51]  In 1975, the  MITS Altair 8800  was released based on the  Intel 8080 CPU , and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company. [52]  Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company. [53]  He explained his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave." [54] 
Gates read the January 1975 issue of  Popular Electronics  which demonstrated the  Altair 8800 , and contacted  Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a  BASIC  interpreter for the platform. [55]  In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president  Ed Roberts  agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair  emulator  that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in  Albuquerque, New Mexico ; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as  Altair BASIC . MITS hired Allen, [56]  and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator  Ric Weiland . [56]  They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976. [56]  Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft 's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an  Open Letter to Hobbyists  in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. [57]  This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. [56]  The company moved from Albuquerque to  Bellevue, Washington  on January 1, 1979. [55] 
Gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive. [58] 
DONKEY.BAS , is a  computer game  written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a  driving game  in which the  player  must avoid hitting  donkeys . The game was written by Gates and  Neil Konzen . [59] [60] 
IBM , the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the  IBM PC , [61]  after Gates's mother,  Mary Maxwell Gates , mentioned Microsoft to  John Opel , IBM's then  CEO . [62]  IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to  Digital Research  (DRI), makers of the widely used  CP/M  operating system. [63]  IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using  86-DOS , an operating system similar to CP/M, that  Tim Paterson  of  Seattle Computer Products  (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. [64]  Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC [65]  and delivered it to IBM as  PC DOS  for a one-time fee of $50,000. [66] 
The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware. [66]  They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of  MS-DOS  (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry. [67]  The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC.  PC Magazine  asked if Gates was "the man behind the machine?". [61] 
Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a  Hodgkin lymphoma  diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity. [55] [68]  Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside. [26]  They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018. [69] 
Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of  Microsoft Windows  on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from  Apple 's  Macintosh   GUI , which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use. [70]  In August 1986, the company struck a deal with  IBM  to develop a separate operating system called  OS/2 . Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences. [71]  The operating system  grew out of DOS  in an organic fashion over a decade until  Windows 95 , which hid the DOS prompt by default.  Windows XP  was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO. [72]   Windows 8.1  was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to  John W. Thompson  on February 5, 2014. [73] 
During Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the  TRS-80 Model 100 , [74]  but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989. [75]   Jerry Pournelle  wrote in 1985 when Gates announced  Microsoft Excel : "Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat  hack ." [76] 
On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed  Ray Ozzie  in charge of management and  Craig Mundie  in charge of long-term product strategy. [77]  The process took two years to fully transfer his duties to Ozzie and Mundie, and was completed on June 27, 2008. [78] 
Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014 [update] , most of Gates's assets are held in  Cascade Investment  LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including  Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts , and  Corbis Corp. [79]  On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become "technology advisor" at the firm to support newly appointed CEO  Satya Nadella . [11] [80] 
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014, issue of  Rolling Stone  magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a  pandemic , or  nuclear  or  bioterrorism ." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been." [81] 
Gates has often expressed concern about the potential harms of  superintelligence ; in a  Reddit  "ask me anything", he stated that:
First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with  Elon Musk  and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned. [82] [83] [84] [85]In an interview that was held at the  TED conference  in March 2015, with  Baidu  co-founder and CEO,  Robin Li , Gates said he would "highly recommend"  Nick Bostrom 's recent work,  Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies . [86]  During the conference, Gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the  COVID-19 pandemic  began. [87]  In March 2018, Gates met at his home in Seattle with  Mohammed bin Salman , the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of  Saudi Arabia  to discuss investment opportunities for  Saudi Vision 2030 . [88] [89]  In June 2019, Gates admitted that losing the  mobile operating system  race to  Android  was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their  skill set  of being the dominant player, but partially blames the  antitrust  litigation during the time. [90]  That same year, Gates became an advisory board member of the  Bloomberg New Economy Forum . [91] 
On March 13, 2020, Microsoft announced Gates would be leaving his board positions at Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate himself to philanthropic endeavors such as climate change, global health and development, and education. [12] 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the issue, despite him not being a  public official  or having any prior  medical training . [92]  His foundation did, however, establish the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator in 2020 to hasten the development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for  COVID-19 , [93]  and, as of February 2021, Gates expressed that he and  Anthony Fauci  frequently talk and collaborate on matters including vaccines and other medical innovations to fight the pandemic. [94] 
Gates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stakes in companies in various sectors and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including:
Gates considers  climate change  and  global access to energy  to be critical, interrelated issues. He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in  sustainable energy  technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices. [123]  In 2011, he said: "If you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, I'd pick the energy thing." [124] 
In 2015, he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world's energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources. Global  energy transitions  have historically taken decades. He wrote, "I believe we can make this transition faster, both because the pace of innovation is accelerating, and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another." [125]  This rapid transition, according to Gates, would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private-sector investment, to enable innovation in diverse areas such as  nuclear energy ,  grid energy storage  to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy, and  solar fuels . [126] 
Gates spearheaded two initiatives that he announced at the  2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference  in Paris. One was  Mission Innovation , in which 20 national governments pledged to double their spending on research and development for carbon-free energy in over five years' time. [123]  Another initiative was  Breakthrough Energy , a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. Gates, who had already invested $1 billion of his own money in innovative energy startups, committed a further $1 billion to Breakthrough Energy. [126]  In December 2020, he called for the U.S. federal government to create institutes for clean energy research, analogous to the  National Institutes of Health . [127]  Gates has also urged rich nations to shift to 100%  synthetic beef  industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production. [128] 
Gates has been criticised for holding a large stake in  Signature Aviation , a company that services emissions-intensive private jets. [129]  In 2019, he began to  divest from fossil fuels . He does not expect divestment itself to have much practical impact, but says that if his efforts to provide alternatives were to fail, he would not want to personally benefit from an increase in fossil fuel stock prices. [130]  After he published his book  How to Avoid a Climate Disaster , parts of the climate activist community criticized Gate's approach as  technological solutionism . [131]  In 2022, educational streamer  Wondrium  produced the series "Solving for Zero: The Search for Climate Innovation" inspired by the book. [132] 
In June 2021, Gates's company  TerraPower  and  Warren Buffett 's  PacifiCorp  announced the first  sodium  nuclear reactor in  Wyoming . Wyoming Governor  Mike Gordon  hailed the project as a step toward carbon-negative nuclear power. Wyoming Senator  John Barrasso  also said that it could boost the state's once-active uranium mining industry. [133] 
Gates spent many efforts to make pass the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022  because of his importance to climate. He tried to convince  Joe Manchin  to support a climate bill from the year 2019 and especially in the months before the adoption of the bill. The bill should cut the global greenhouse gas emissions in a level similar to "eliminating the annual planet-warming pollution of France and Germany combined" and may help to limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees – the target of the  Paris Agreement . [134]  He thanked both Joe Manchin and  Chuck Schumer  for their efforts in a guest essay in  The New York Times , where he said "Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history" given its potential to spur development of new technologies. [135]  Gates gave further insights on climate change in his commencement address at Northern Arizona University on May 6, 2023, where he was bestowed an honorary doctorate. [136] 
In 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate. [137]  During the  Federal Trade Commission 's (FTC) investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at Commissioner  Dennis Yao  for "float[ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power". According to one source:
Gates was vexed. "He started by calling Yao's ideas socialistic," recalls a source familiar with the July 15 meeting, "and as he got angrier and angrier and louder and louder, he got into calling them Communistic." [138]On February 18, 2021, after  Facebook  and  Twitter  had banned  Donald Trump  from their platforms as a result of the  2020 United States presidential election  which led to the  January 6 United States Capitol attack , Gates said a permanent ban of Trump "would be a shame" and would be an "extreme measure". He warned that it would cause "polarization" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: "I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good." [137] 
In April 2021, during the  COVID-19 pandemic , Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for  COVID-19 vaccines . The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the  University of Essex  stated, "Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. It's disgusting." [139] 
Gates is opposed to the  TRIPS waiver . [140] [141] [142]   Bloomberg News  reported him as saying he argued that Oxford University should not give away the rights to its COVID-19 information, as it had announced, but instead sell it to a single industry partner, as it did. [143]  His views on the value of  legal monopolies  in medicine have been linked to his views on legal monopolies in software. [141] [142] 
Gates has been critical of  cryptocurrencies  like  Bitcoin . According to Gates, cryptocurrencies provide no "valuable output", contribute nothing to society, and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses. Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself. [144] 
Gates studied the work of  Andrew Carnegie  and  John D. Rockefeller , and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's largest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. [145] [146]  The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the  Wellcome Trust . [147] [148]  Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to the  Carnegie Mellon University  for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009. [149] [150] 
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of  David Rockefeller  as a major influence. He and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the  Rockefeller family 's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. [151] 
The foundation is organized into five program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division. Among others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such  AIDS ,  tuberculosis  and  malaria , as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate  polio . It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities. The foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries. [152]  Its agriculture division supports the  International Rice Research Institute  in developing  Golden Rice , a genetically modified rice variant used to combat  vitamin A deficiency . [153]  The foundation aims to provide women and girls in the developing world with information and support regarding contraception and, ultimately, universal access to consensual  family planning . [154]  In 2007, the  Los Angeles Times  criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to  developing countries . [155]  Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility, [156]  it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices. [157] 
Gates delivered his thoughts in a fireside chat moderated by journalist and news anchor  Shereen Bhan  virtually at the  Singapore FinTech Festival  on December 8, 2020, on the topic, "Building Infrastructure for Resilience: What the  COVID-19  Response Can Teach Us About How to Scale Financial Inclusion". [158] 
Governments are there to think ahead to bad things that might happen. In the case of (the COVID-19) pandemic, not enough was done. We can't forget that another pandemic will come and we'll need to invest in being ready in that, ... while not forgetting that we were not prepared and we're going to have to invest – just like having a fire department – some money in an intelligent way and actually simulate what might happen and make sure that we're ready for it. [158]Gates favors the normalization of COVID-19 masks. In a November 2020 interview, he said: "What are these, like, nudists? I mean, you know, we ask you to wear pants, and no American says, or very few Americans say, that that's, like, some terrible thing." [159] 
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book,  The Power of Half . [160]  Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor  Warren Buffett  each signed a commitment they called the " Giving Pledge ", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity. [161] [162] [163] 
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect  Frank Gehry . While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates. [164] 
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the  Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the school's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction. [165]  Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of  Stanford University . The building contains the Computer Science Department and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department. [166] 
Since 2005, Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global  sanitation  problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest. [167]  To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – it was produced from a  sewage sludge treatment  process called the  Omni Processor . [168] [169]  In early 2015, he also appeared with  Jimmy Fallon  on  The Tonight Show  and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this  reclaimed water  or bottled water. [170] 
In November 2017, Gates said he would give $50 million to the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital fund that seeks treatment for  Alzheimer's disease . He also pledged an additional $50 million to start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research. [171]  Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they are expected to give away about 99.96% of their wealth. [172]  On August 25, 2018, Gates distributed $600,000 through his foundation via  UNICEF  which is helping flood affected victims in  Kerala , India. [173] 
In June 2018, Gates offered free  ebooks , to all new graduates of U.S. colleges and universities, [174]  and in 2021, offered free ebooks, to all college and university students around the world. [175] [176]  The Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation partially funds  OpenStax , which creates and provides free digital textbooks. [177] 
In July 2022 he reiterated the commitment he had made by starting  The Giving Pledge  campaign by announcing on his Twitter channel he planned to give 'virtually all' his wealth to charity and eventually 'move off of the list of the world's richest people.' [178] 
On April 29, 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend  Roger Federer  in playing in the  Match for Africa 4 , a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out  Key Arena  in Seattle. The event was in support of the  Roger Federer Foundation 's charity efforts in Africa. [179]  Federer and Gates played against  John Isner , the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and  Mike McCready , the lead guitarist for  Pearl Jam . The pair won the match 6 games to 4. Overall, they raised $2 million for children in Africa. [180]  The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the  Match for Africa 5  on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's  SAP Center . Their opponents were  Jack Sock , one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and  Savannah Guthrie , a co-anchor for  NBC 's  Today  show. Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6–3 and the event raised over $2.5 million. [181] 
Gates has so far authored four books:
Gates is an avid reader, [185]  and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from  The Great Gatsby . [186]  He also enjoys bridge, tennis and golf. [187] [188]  His days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the  U.S. president 's schedule. [189]  Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew  coach  (economy class) in  commercial aircraft  until 1997, when he bought a private jet. [190] 
Gates purchased the  Codex Leicester , a collection of scientific writings by  Leonardo da Vinci , for US$30.8 million at an auction in 1994. [191]  In 1998, he reportedly paid $30 million for the original 1885 maritime painting  Lost on the Grand Banks , at the time a record price for an American painting. [192]  In 2016, he revealed that he was  color-blind . [193]  On May 10, 2022, Gates said that he tested positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing mild symptoms. [194]  Gates has received three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. [194] 
Gates married  Melinda French  on the Hawaiian Island of  Lanai  on January 1, 1994. [195]  They met in 1987 after Melinda began working at Microsoft. [196]  At the time of their marriage, Gates was given permission by Melinda to spend limited time with his ex-girlfriend, businesswoman  Ann Winblad . [197]  Bill and Melinda have three children: Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe. [198]  The family's  residence  is an  earth-sheltered mansion  in the side of a hill overlooking  Lake Washington  in  Medina, Washington . In 2009,  property taxes  on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million. [199]  The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m 2 ) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230 m 2 ) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93 m 2 ) dining room. [200]  On May 3, 2021, the Gateses announced they had decided to divorce after 27 years of marriage and 34 years as a couple. [201]  They said they would keep working together on charitable efforts. [201] [202]   The Wall Street Journal  reported that Melinda had been meeting with divorce attorneys since 2019, citing interviews that suggested Bill's ties with Jeffrey Epstein was at least one of her concerns. [203]  The divorce was finalized on August 2, 2021. [204] 
Gates's public image has changed over the years. At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless "robber baron", a "nerd-turned-tycoon". [205]  Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education. His image morphed from "tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior" to a "huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change. [205]  Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing. Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein . [206]  This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from "a lovable nerd who was out to save the world" to "a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health." [207] 
Investigative journalist Tim Schwab has accused Gates of using his contributions to the media to shape their coverage of him in order to protect his public image. [92] [208]  In September 2022,  Politico  published an exposé critical of NGO leadership at the helm of the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic response, written in cooperation with the German newspaper  Welt .  Criticisms included the interconnectivity of the non-profits with Gates, as well as his personal lack of formal credentials in medicine. [209] 
Gates and the projects of his foundation have been the subject of many conspiracy theories that proliferate on Facebook and elsewhere. He has been implausibly accused of attempting to depopulate the world, distributing harmful or unethical vaccines, and implanting people with privacy-violating microchips. These largely unfounded theories reached a new level of influence during the COVID-19 pandemic when, according to  New York Times  journalist Rory Smith, the uncertainties of pandemic life drove people to seek explanations from the Internet. [210] [211]  When asked about the theories, Gates has remarked that some people are tempted by the "simple explanation" that an evil person rather than biological factors are to blame, and that he does not know for what purpose anyone believes he would want to track them with microchips. [212] [213] 
In an interview with  Rolling Stone , Gates said in regard to his faith: "The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief." [214]  In the same 2014 interview he also said: "I agree with people like  Richard Dawkins  that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." [214] 
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$100 billion making him the first person ever to achieve the feat. [215] [190]  Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings declined due to the fall in Microsoft's stock price after the  dot-com bubble  burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he had made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention that it brought. [216]  In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person after   Carlos Slim , but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. [217] [218]  Slim retook the position again in June 2014 [219] [220]  (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to US$82 billion. [221]  In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by  Amazon  founder  Jeff Bezos  as the richest person in the world. [16]  On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares, surpassing Bezos. [222]  Gates told the  BBC , "I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so ... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes." [223]  He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich. [224] 
By 2017, Gates had held the top spot on the list of  The World's Billionaires  in 18 out of the previous 23 years. [225]  Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of US$616,667 and US$350,000 bonus totalling US$966,667. [226]  In 1989, he founded  Corbis , a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a board member of  Berkshire Hathaway , the investment company headed by long-time friend  Warren Buffett . [227] 
In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in  Forbes  magazine's first ever  America's richest  issue and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.25 billion. [14]  Since 1987, Gates has been included in the  Forbes  The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest person from 1995 to 1996, [228]  1998 to 2007, 2009, and held the spot until 2018 before being overtaken by  Jeff Bezos . [15]  Gates was number one on the  Forbes 400  list of wealthiest Americans from 1993 through to 2007, 2009, and 2014 through 2017. [229] [230] 
During his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to  antitrust  litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998  United States v. Microsoft  case, Gates gave  deposition  testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner  David Boies  over the contextual meaning of words such as "compete", "concerned", and "we". Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head. [231]   BusinessWeek  reported:
Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying "I don't recall" so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received. [232]Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty ... rudeness to Boies in the first degree." [233]  Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed  monopolization ,  tying  and blocking competition, each in violation of the  Sherman Antitrust Act . [233] 
Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls." [234]  An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor". [235] 
In the early 1980s, while business partner Paul Allen was undergoing treatments for  cancer , Gates — according to Allen — conspired to reduce the latter's share in Microsoft  by issuing himself stock options. [236] [237] [238]  In his autobiography, Allen would later recall that Gates was "scheming to rip me off. It was mercenary opportunism plain and simple". [236]  Gates says he remembers the episode differently. [237]  Allen would also recall that Gates was prone to shouting episodes. [238] 
Gates has often been accused of bullying Microsoft employees. [239]  He met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative, berating them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. [240] [241]  Gates saw competition in personal terms; when  Borland 's  Turbo Pascal  performed better than Microsoft's own tools, he yelled at programming director  Greg Whitten  "for half an hour" because, Gates believed, Borland's  Philippe Kahn  had surpassed Gates. [242]  Gates interrupted presentations with such comments as "that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard" [243]  and "why don't you just give up your  options  and join the  Peace Corps ?" [244]  The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced. [243]  Not all harsh language was criticism; a manager recalled that "You're full of shit. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard" meant that Gates was amazed. "In the lore of Microsoft, if Bill says that to you, you're made". [245]  When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend". [246] [75] [247] 
A 2019  New York Times  article reported that Gates's relationship with financier  Jeffrey Epstein  started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a  child for prostitution , and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort. [248]  Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: "His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me". [206] 
The depth of the friendship between Gates and Epstein is unclear though Gates generally commented that "I met him. I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him". [249]  However, Gates visited Epstein "many times, despite [Epstein's] past". [248]  It was reported that Epstein and Gates "discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy". [248]  However, in an interview in 2019 Gates completely denied any connection between Epstein and the Gates Foundation or his philanthropy generally. [249]   In August 2021, Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. Gates added, "It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there." [239]  Gates came under further scrutiny after it was revealed that he had travelled on Epstein's private jet, though further claims about Gates travelling to Little St James proved unsubstantiated. [250] 
It has also been reported that Epstein and Gates met with  Nobel Committee  chair  Thorbjørn Jagland  at his residence in  Strasbourg, France  in March 2013 to discuss the  Nobel Prize . [251]  Also in attendance were representatives of the  International Peace Institute  which has received millions in grants from the  Gates Foundation , including a $2.5 million "community engagement" grant in October 2013. [252]  In 2023, it was reported that Epstein threatened to expose an alleged affair Gates had with a Russian bridge player. [253] 
Gates was the guest on  BBC Radio 4 's  Desert Island Discs  on January 31, 2016, in which he talked about his relationships with his  father  and  Steve Jobs , meeting  Melinda Ann French , the start of  Microsoft  and some of his habits (for example reading  The Economist  "from cover to cover every week"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: " Blue Skies " by  Willie Nelson ; a book:  The Better Angels of Our Nature  by  Steven Pinker ; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from  The Teaching Company . [298] 
Gates made a guest appearance as himself on the TV show  The Big Bang Theory . The episode on which he appeared was appropriately titled " The Gates Excitation ". [299]  He also appeared in a cameo role in 2019 on the series finale of  Silicon Valley . [300]  Gates was parodied in  The Simpsons  episode " Das Bus ".
In 2023, Gates was the interviewee in an episode of the  Amol Rajan  Interviews  series on  BBC Two , [301]  and was the subject of an episode of the UK  Channel 4  series  The Billionaires Who Made Our World . [302]

Surname: Gelernter
Awards: 13
Education: Gelernter grew up on  Long Island, New York . [2]  His father  Herbert Gelernter  was a  physicist  who, in the late 1950s and 1960s, became a pioneer in  artificial intelligence  and taught computer science at  State University of New York at Stony Brook . [3] [4]  Gelernter's grandfather was a  rabbi , and Gelernter grew up as a  Reform Jew ; he later became a follower of  Orthodox Judaism . [5] 
He received his  Bachelor of Arts  and  Master of Arts  degrees in  Classical Hebrew  literature from  Yale University  in 1976. [6]  He earned his  Ph.D.  from State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1982. [2] 
In the 1980s, Gelernter made seminal contributions to the field of  parallel computation , specifically the  tuple space  coordination model, as embodied by the  Linda  programming system he and Nicholas Carriero designed (which he named for  Linda Lovelace , the lead actress in the porn movie  Deep Throat , mocking the naming of the programming language  Ada  in tribute to the scientist and first attributed computer programmer,  Ada Lovelace ). [7] [2]   Bill Joy  cited the Linda system as the inspiration for many elements of  JavaSpaces  and  Jini . [8] 
In January 1993 in his book  Mirror Worlds: or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox...How It Will Happen and What It Will Mean , Gelernter wrote: "...people and software work hand-in-glove – and sometimes hand-in-hand." [9] 
On June 24, 1993, Gelernter was severely injured opening a  mail bomb  sent to him by the  Unabomber . He recovered from his injuries, but his right hand (which he covers with a glove) and eye were permanently damaged. [10] [11]  Some in the press suggested that there were parallels between his thoughts on the need for a human element to computers and those of the Unabomber. [2]  He chronicled the ordeal in his 1997 book  Drawing Life: Surviving the Unabomber . [12]  Two years after the bombing, the Unabomber sent Gelernter a letter, writing: "People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are." [13] 
Gelernter helped found the company  Mirror Worlds Technologies , which in 2001 released Scopeware software using ideas from his 1992 book  Mirror Worlds . Gelernter believed that computers can free users from being filing clerks, by organizing their data. The product never took off, however, [14]  and the company ceased operations in 2004. [14]   In 2013, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, a related company that had purchased its patents, filed a complaint of  patent infringement  against Apple, Best Buy, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo (United States), Lenovo Group, Microsoft, Samsung Electronic, and Samsung TeleCommunications in the  United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas . [15]  Ultimately, the company lost at the trial level and on appeal. [14]   A  petition for writ of certiorari  to have the case considered by the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2013. [16]  In 2016, the case was dismissed  with prejudice . [15] 
In July 2019, Gelernter, along with 3 other co-founders, started Revolution Populi: A blockchain-powered crypto clearing house and social network. The team also includes Rob Rosenthal, a 19-year veteran of Goldman Sachs. [17] 
Gelernter's paintings have been exhibited, sold, stolen and recovered in New Haven and Manhattan. [18] 
Gelernter has critiqued what he perceives as cultural illiteracy among students. In 2015, he commented, "They [students] know nothing about art. They know nothing about history. They know nothing about philosophy. And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don't rise to the level of atheists, insofar as they've never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God. It has never occurred to them. They know nothing about the Bible." [19]  In 2016 he said: "The [Yale] faculty and the students don't have a clue what's going on in the world." [20] 
He is a former national fellow at the  American Enterprise Institute  and senior fellow in  Jewish thought  at the  Shalem Center . In 2003, he became a member of the  National Council on the Arts . [21]   Time  magazine profiled Gelernter in 2016, describing him as a "stubbornly independent thinker. A conservative among mostly liberal  Ivy League  professors, a religious believer among the often disbelieving ranks of computer scientists..." [22] 
Endorsing  Donald Trump  for president, in October 2016, Gelernter wrote an op-ed in  The Wall Street Journal  calling  Hillary Clinton  "as phony as a three-dollar bill", and saying that  Barack Obama  "has governed like a third-rate tyrant". [23] [24]  In his capacity as a member of the  Trump transition team ,  Peter Thiel  nominated Gelernter for the  Science Advisor to the President  position; Gelernter did meet with Trump in January 2017 but did not get the job. [25] 
In 2018, he said that the idea that Trump is a racist "is absurd." [26]  In October 2020 he joined in signing a letter stating: "Given his astonishing success in his first term, we believe that Donald Trump is the candidate most likely to foster the promise and prosperity of America." [27] 
Gelernter has spoken out against  women in the workforce , saying working mothers were harming their children and should stay at home. [13]  Gelernter has also argued for the U.S.  voting age  to be raised, on the basis that 18-year-olds are not sufficiently mature. [28] 
The Washington Post , profiling him in early 2017 as a potential science advisor to  Donald Trump , called Gelernter "a vehement critic of modern academia" who has "condemned 'belligerent leftists' and blamed intellectualism for the disintegration of patriotism and traditional family values." [29]  Shortly thereafter,  The Atlantic  published a rebuttal of  The Washington Post  profile, saying it was "hard to imagine a more misleading treatment" of the "pioneering polymath" Gelernter. [30] 
Gelernter has " expressed skepticism about the reality " of  anthropogenic climate change ," [31] [32]  rejecting  the overwhelming scientific consensus in the field . [33] 
In July 2019, in a review of  Stephen Meyer 's book  Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design , which Gelernter wrote for the  Claremont Review of Books , he also rejected the scientific consensus of  evolutionary biology . [34]  On the other hand, Gelernter stipulates he "cannot accept"  intelligent design  either, saying that "as a theory, it would seem to have a long way to go." [35]  In "A Response to David Gelernter's Attack on Evolution",  Patheos , August 26, 2019, Bob Seidensticker writes: "Let's subtitle this story, 'Guy who made his career in not-biology is convinced by other not-biologists that Biology's core theory is wrong. ' " [36]  Computer scientist and mathematician  Jeffrey Shallit  wrote: "Gelernter's review was not published in a science journal, but in a politics journal run by a far-right think tank. His review cites no scientific publications at all, and makes claims like 'Many biologists agree' and 'Most biologists think' without giving any supporting citations. So, not surprisingly ... Gelernter makes a fool of himself in his review, which resembles a 'greatest hits' of creationist misconceptions and lies." [37] 
Gelernter's book  Mirror Worlds  (1991) "prophesied the rise of the World Wide Web." [38]  Bill Joy, founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, said Gelernter was "one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time." [38]   The New York Times  called him a computer science "rock star". [39] 
In  The Muse in the Machine  (1994), Gelernter theorized that creativity is based on the degree to which people focus their attention, arguing that "low focus", when attention is wandering or emotions interfere with rationality, is when people are creative. [40]  His book was harshly criticized. [40]  Psychologist  Stuart Sutherland , writing in  Nature , called the theory wrong. [40]   Cognitive psychologist   Steven Pinker , director of the  MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , wrote: "It makes a great story, but if you look at the contemporary records and autobiographies, it doesn't work that way." [40] 
In his 2009 book  Judaism: A Way of Being , Gelernter wrote that God has withdrawn from the modern world, that Reform and  Conservative Judaism  do not work, that the purpose of life is to marry and rear a family, and that the  feminist  effort for male and female equality "is an act of aggression against both sanctity and humanity." [41] 
In his 2012 book  America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) , Gelernter argued that American  higher education  no longer cares about producing well-rounded and cultured students; academics instead believe that their role is to dictate how other Americans live and think. Scottish columnist Stephen Daisley wrote in  Commentary  magazine that Gelernter portrayed Obama's presidency as a symbol of the failure of American education and the success of its replacement with a liberal indoctrination system. As a solution, Gelernter proposed moving all of human knowledge to online servers so that the in-person college experience can be replaced by user-driven self-education. Daisley wrote, " America-Lite  is lean, incisive, convincing, delightfully indelicate, and, in a break from the conventions of the literature on education, honest. It is a fine dissection—de-construction, if you must—of the corruption of higher education and the resulting debasement of political culture. If it makes its way on to a single college reading list, Hell will have frozen over." [42] 
Historian  Russell Jacoby  was critical in his review of Gelernter's book  America-Lite , saying it contained insufficient arguments. Jacoby wrote that Gelernter blamed Jews for causing the breakdown of patriotism and the traditional family, writing, "Gelernter is Jewish, and it is not likely that a non-Jew would airily argue that obnoxious leftist Jews have taken over elite higher education." [43] 
Gelernter has contributed to magazines such as  City Journal ,  The Weekly Standard , and  Commentary  that are generally considered  neoconservative . [ citation needed ]  For seven months, he contributed a weekly op-ed column to the  Los Angeles Times . [44]  He has published in  The Wall Street Journal , the  New York Post , the  Los Angeles Times , and the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .

Surname: Gödel
Awards: 3
Education: Gödel was born April 28, 1906, in Brünn,  Austria-Hungary  (now  Brno ,  Czech Republic ), into the German-speaking family of Rudolf Gödel (1874–1929), the managing director and part owner of a major textile firm, and Marianne Gödel ( née  Handschuh, 1879–1966). [6]  At the time of his birth the city had a  German-speaking  majority which included his parents. [7]  His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised as Protestants. The ancestors of Kurt Gödel were often active in Brünn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Gödel was a famous singer in his time and for some years a member of the  Brünner Männergesangverein  (Men's Choral Union of Brünn). [8] 
Gödel automatically became a citizen of  Czechoslovakia  at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed following its defeat in the  First World War . According to his classmate  Klepetař , like many residents of the predominantly German  Sudetenländer , "Gödel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia". [9]  In February 1929, he was granted release from his Czechoslovakian citizenship and then, in April, granted Austrian citizenship. [10]  When  Germany   annexed Austria  in 1938, Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. In 1948, after  World War II , at the age of 42, he became an American citizen. [11] 
In his family, the young Gödel was nicknamed  Herr Warum  ("Mr. Why") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven, Kurt suffered from  rheumatic fever ; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Gödel suffered from "frequent episodes of poor health", which would continue for his entire life. [12] 
Gödel attended the  Evangelische Volksschule , a Lutheran school in Brünn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the  Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium  from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Gödel had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for  Vienna , where he attended medical school at the  University of Vienna . During his teens, Gödel studied  Gabelsberger shorthand ,  Goethe 's  Theory of Colours  and criticisms of  Isaac Newton , and the writings of  Immanuel Kant . [ citation needed ] 
At the age of 18, Gödel joined his brother at the  University of Vienna . By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics. [13]  Although initially intending to study  theoretical physics , he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. [14]  During this time, he adopted ideas of  mathematical realism . He read  Kant 's  Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft , and participated in the  Vienna Circle  with  Moritz Schlick ,  Hans Hahn , and  Rudolf Carnap . Gödel then studied  number theory , but when he took part in a seminar run by  Moritz Schlick  which studied  Bertrand Russell 's book  Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy , he became interested in  mathematical logic . According to Gödel, mathematical logic was "a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences." [15] 
Attending a lecture by  David Hilbert  in  Bologna  on completeness and consistency in mathematical systems may have set Gödel's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and  Wilhelm Ackermann  published  Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik  ( Principles of Mathematical Logic ), an introduction to  first-order logic  in which the problem of completeness was posed: "Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?"
This problem became the topic that Gödel chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral  dissertation  under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established his eponymous  completeness theorem  regarding the  first-order predicate calculus . He was awarded his doctorate in 1930, and his thesis (accompanied by some additional work) was published by the  Vienna Academy of Science .
Kurt Gödel's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental—indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with Gödel's achievement.In 1930 Gödel attended the  Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences , held in  Königsberg , 5–7 September. Here he delivered his  incompleteness theorems . [17] 
Gödel published his incompleteness theorems in  Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der  Principia Mathematica  und verwandter Systeme  (called in English " On Formally Undecidable Propositions of  Principia Mathematica  and Related Systems "). In that article, he proved for any  computable   axiomatic system  that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the  natural numbers  (e.g., the  Peano axioms  or  Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ), that:
These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of  Gottlob Frege  and culminating in  Principia Mathematica  and  Hilbert's Program , to find a non- relatively  consistent axiomatization sufficient for number theory (that was to serve as the foundation for other fields of mathematics).
In hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. Gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false.
Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.
That is, for any  computably enumerable  set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.
To make this precise, however, Gödel needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as  Gödel numbering .
In his two-page paper  Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül  (1932) Gödel refuted the finite-valuedness of  intuitionistic logic . In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as  Gödel–Dummett intermediate logic  (or  Gödel fuzzy logic ).
Gödel earned his  habilitation  at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a  Privatdozent  (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933  Adolf Hitler  came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians. In June 1936,  Moritz Schlick , whose seminar had aroused Gödel's interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students,  Johann Nelböck . This triggered "a severe nervous crisis" in Gödel. [18]  He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases. [19] 
In 1933, Gödel first traveled to the U.S., where he met  Albert Einstein , who became a good friend. [20]  He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the  American Mathematical Society . During this year, Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and  recursive functions  to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using  Gödel numbering .
In 1934, Gödel gave a series of lectures at the  Institute for Advanced Study  (IAS) in  Princeton, New Jersey , titled  On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems .  Stephen Kleene , who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published.
Gödel visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The travelling and the hard work had exhausted him and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the  axiom of choice  and of the  continuum hypothesis ; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.
He married  Adele Nimbursky  [ es  ;   ast ]  (née Porkert, 1899–1981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938. Gödel's parents had opposed their relationship because she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was.
Subsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing  Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory, [21]  a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the  constructible universe , a model of  set theory  in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the  axiom of choice  (AC) and the  generalized continuum hypothesis  (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the  Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms  for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the  Hahn–Banach theorem .  Paul Cohen  later constructed a  model  of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.
Gödel spent the spring of 1939 at the  University of Notre Dame . [22] 
After the  Anschluss  on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of  Nazi Germany .
Germany abolished the title  Privatdozent , so Gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down.
His predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939.
Before the year was up, Gödel and his wife left Vienna for  Princeton . To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the Gödels took the  Trans-Siberian Railway  to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the US by train to Princeton. There Gödel accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), which he had previously visited during 1933–34. [23] 
Albert Einstein was also living at Princeton during this time. Gödel and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist  Oskar Morgenstern  recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his "own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel". [24] 
Gödel and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in  Blue Hill, Maine , at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. Gödel was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using  Heft 15  [volume 15] of Gödel's still-unpublished  Arbeitshefte  [working notebooks],  John W. Dawson Jr.  conjectures that Gödel discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. Gödel's close friend  Hao Wang  supports this conjecture, noting that Gödel's Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem.
On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied Gödel to his  U.S. citizenship  exam, where they acted as witnesses. Gödel had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the  U.S. Constitution  that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship; this has since been dubbed  Gödel's Loophole . Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be  Phillip Forman , who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel if he thought a dictatorship like the  Nazi regime  could happen in the U.S. Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gödel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion. [25] [26] 
Gödel became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976. [27] 
During his time at the institute, Gödel's interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving  closed timelike curves , to  Einstein's field equations  in  general relativity . [28]  He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday. [29]  His "rotating universes" would allow  time travel  to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the  Gödel metric  (an exact solution of the  Einstein field equation ).
He studied and admired the works of  Gottfried Leibniz , but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz's works to be suppressed. [30]  To a lesser extent he studied  Immanuel Kant  and  Edmund Husserl . In the early 1970s, Gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz's version of  Anselm of Canterbury 's  ontological proof  of God's existence. This is now known as  Gödel's ontological proof .
Gödel was awarded (with  Julian Schwinger ) the first  Albert Einstein Award  in 1951, and was also awarded the  National Medal of Science , in 1974. [31]  Gödel was elected a resident member of the  American Philosophical Society  in 1961 and a  Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1968 . [32] [1]  He was a Plenary Speaker of the  ICM  in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [33] 
Later in his life, Gödel suffered periods of  mental instability  and illness. Following the assassination of his close friend  Moritz Schlick , [34]  Gödel developed an  obsessive fear of being poisoned , and would eat only food prepared by his wife Adele. Adele was hospitalized beginning in late 1977, and in her absence Gödel refused to eat; [35]  he weighed 29 kilograms (65 lb) when he died of "malnutrition and  inanition  caused by personality disturbance" in  Princeton Hospital  on January 14, 1978. [36]  He was buried in  Princeton Cemetery . Adele died in 1981. [37] 
Gödel believed that God [38]  was personal, and called his philosophy "rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological". [39] 
Gödel believed in an afterlife, saying, "Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today's science and received wisdom haven't any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology." It is "possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning" that it "is entirely consistent with known facts." "If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife]." [40] 
In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is  theistic , not  pantheistic , following  Leibniz  rather than  Spinoza ." [41]  Of religion(s) in general, he said: "Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not". [42]  According to his wife Adele, "Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning", [43]  while of  Islam , he said, "I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded." [44] 
Douglas Hofstadter  wrote the 1979 book  Gödel, Escher, Bach  to celebrate the work and ideas of Gödel,  M. C. Escher  and  Johann Sebastian Bach . It partly explores the ramifications of the fact that Gödel's incompleteness theorem can be applied to any  Turing-complete  computational system, which may include the  human brain .
The  Kurt Gödel Society , founded in 1987, is an international organization for the promotion of research in logic, philosophy, and the  history of mathematics . The  University of Vienna  hosts the Kurt Gödel Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The  Association for Symbolic Logic  has held an annual  Gödel Lecture  each year since 1990.  Gödel's Philosophical Notebooks   Archived  May 14, 2019, at the  Wayback Machine  are edited at the  Kurt Gödel Research Centre   Archived  May 14, 2019, at the  Wayback Machine  which is situated at the  Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities  in Germany.
Five volumes of Gödel's collected works have been published. The first two include his publications; the third includes unpublished manuscripts from his  Nachlass , and the final two include correspondence.
In 2005  John Dawson  published a biography of Gödel,  Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Gödel  ( A. K. Peters , Wellesley, MA,  ISBN   1-56881-256-6 ).  Stephen Budiansky 's book about Gödel's life,  Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel  ( W. W. Norton & Company , New York City, NY,  ISBN   978-0-393-35820-9 ), was a  New York Times  Critics' Top Book of 2021. [45] 
Gödel was also one of four mathematicians examined in  David Malone 's 2008  BBC  documentary  Dangerous Knowledge . [46] 
The  Gödel Prize  is given annually for an outstanding paper in theoretical computer science.

Surname: Gunther
Awards: 9
Education: Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He attended Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther received a copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory , replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware . Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column . He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School . His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station , borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes . At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore - auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory .

Surname: Hopper
Awards: 9
Education: Grace Brewster Murray was born in  New York City . She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of  Scottish  and  Dutch  descent, and attended  West End Collegiate Church . [8]  Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the  Battle of Mobile Bay  during the  Civil War . [8] : 2–3  
Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). [9]  Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, “Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ I try to fight that. That’s why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.” [10]  For her  preparatory school  education, she attended the  Hartridge School  in  Plainfield, New Jersey . Grace was initially rejected for early admission to  Vassar College  at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated  Phi Beta Kappa  from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at  Yale University  in 1930.
In 1930, Grace Murray married  New York University  professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945. [11] [12]  She did not marry again and retained his surname.
In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale [13]  under the direction of  Øystein Ore . [11] [14]  Her  dissertation , "New Types of Irreducibility Criteria", [15]  was published that same year. [16]  She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941. [17] 
Hopper tried to commission in the Navy early in  World War II , however she was turned down. At age 34, she was too old to enlist and her weight-to-height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. [18]  During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the  United States Navy Reserve ; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the  WAVES .
She had to get an exemption to commission; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at  Smith College  in  Northampton, Massachusetts . Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the  Bureau of Ships  Computation Project at  Harvard University  as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the  Mark I computer  programming staff headed by  Howard H. Aiken .
Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard. [19] 
In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the  Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation  as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the  UNIVAC I . [17]  Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I. [20] 
When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." Still, she persisted. "It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols," she explained. "So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code." [21] 
Her idea was not accepted for three years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the  Remington Rand  corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original  compiler  work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was  A-0 . [22] : 11  
In 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that "Nobody believed that," and that she "had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic." [23] 
In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming. [17]  Beginning in 1954, Hopper's work was influenced by the  Laning and Zierler system , which was the first compiler to accept algebraic notation as input. [24]  Her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including  MATH-MATIC  and  FLOW-MATIC . [17] 
Hopper said that her compiler  A-0 , "translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are, they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of  COBOL , a  computer language  for data processors. I could say 'Subtract income tax from pay' instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.  COBOL  is the major language used today in data processing." [25] 
In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages ( CODASYL ). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language  COBOL  (an acronym for  CO mmon  B usiness- O riented  L anguage). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the  IBM  equivalent,  COMTRAN .  Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in  machine code  or in languages close to machine code, such as  assembly languages ) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date. [26]  Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was  Mount Holyoke College  alumna  Jean E. Sammet . [27] 
From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of  captain  in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy. [19] 
In the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network. [22] : 119   She developed the implementation of  standards  for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early  programming languages  such as  FORTRAN  and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST).
In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of  commander  at age 60 at the end of 1966. [28]  She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to  captain  in 1973 by  Admiral   Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. [29] 
After  Republican  Representative  Philip Crane  saw her on a March 1983 segment of  60 Minutes , he championed  H.J.Res. 341 , a joint  resolution  originating in the  House of Representatives  to promote Hopper to  commodore  on the retired list; the resolution was referred to, but not reported out of, the  Senate Armed Services Committee . [30]  Hopper was instead promoted to commodore on December 15, 1983 via the  Appointments Clause  by President  Ronald Reagan . [31] [29] [32] [33] [34]  She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. [35]  Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed  rear admiral  (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.
Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Rear Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986. [36]  At the time, she was the oldest serving member of the Navy. At a celebration held in Boston on the  USS  Constitution  to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the  Defense Distinguished Service Medal , the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense. [37] 
At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days). [38] 
Admirals  William D. Leahy ,  Chester W. Nimitz ,  Hyman G. Rickover  and  Charles Stewart  were the only other officers in the Navy's history to serve on active duty at a higher age. Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of  fleet admiral .
Admiral Hopper was the first ever person to be profiled twice on  60 Minutes , first in March 1983, and the second on August 24, 1986.
Following her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to  Digital Equipment Corporation  (DEC). Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer, a tech-track SVP-equivalent. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. [39]  She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.
At DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures contrary to U.S. Department of Defense policy. [40]  In 2016 Hopper received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science.
"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler," she said, "is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances." [41] 
Throughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname "Grandma COBOL". [42] 
While Hopper was working on a  Mark II  Computer at Harvard University in 1947, [43]  her associates discovered a  moth  that was stuck in a  relay  and impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, “First actual case of bug being found”. While neither she nor her crew members mentioned the exact phrase, " debugging ", in their log entries, the case is held as a historical instance of "debugging" a computer and Hopper is credited with popularizing the term in computing. For many decades, the term "bug" for a malfunction had been in use in several fields before being applied to  computers . [44] [45]  The remains of the moth can be found taped into the group's log book at the  Smithsonian Institution 's  National Museum of American History  in  Washington, D.C. [43] 
Hopper became known for her  nanoseconds  visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why  satellite  communication took so long.  She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long—11.8 inches (30 cm)—the distance that light travels in one  nanosecond . She gave these pieces of wire the  metonym  "nanoseconds." [34]  She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum distance the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out "nanoseconds" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet (300 meters) long, [46]  representing a  microsecond . Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper  picoseconds . [47] 
Jay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be "'all Navy', but when you reach inside, you find a 'Pirate' dying to be released." [48] 
On New Year's Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington County, Virginia; [49]  she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in  Arlington National Cemetery . [50] 
Her legacy was an inspiring factor in the creation of the  Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing . [107]  Held yearly, this conference is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. [108]

Surname: Hui
Awards: 2
Education: Hui was born in  Hong Kong  in 1953. In 1966, he immigrated to  Canada  with his entire family. [3] 
In 1973, Hui entered the  University of Alberta . In his second year he took a course on  probability  and  statistics  in which students were expected to learn the programming language  APL  with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the  APL\360 User's Manual  (the book  APL Language  was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by  Adin Falkoff  and  Kenneth E. Iverson , Hui thought it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson.
As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at  I. P. Sharp Associates  (IPSA) in  Calgary , on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL.
After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in  computer science  in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time  programmer  and analyst in the new  Edmonton  office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL  time-sharing . He attended the APL79 conference in  Rochester, New York , where Iverson gave two papers: "The Role of Operators in APL" and "The Derivative Operator". On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of "Operators and Functions" [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since. [ citation needed ] 
In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the  University of Toronto , and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on "The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra." [4] 
After completing his master's degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL  systems analyst  and programmer for the  Alberta Energy Company  in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased  A Source Book in APL  (1981), in which the most memorable papers were "The Design of APL" (1973), "The Evolution of APL" (1978), and "Notation as a Tool of Thought" (1980).
Hui's work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, "DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System", written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in "Direct Definition" (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson's  The Design of APL  was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson's  Rationalized APL  (1983) and  A Dictionary of the APL Language , as it was then named.
Hui and his wife Stella had two children.  He died on October 16, 2021, from cancer. [5]

Surname: Iverson
Awards: 4
Education: Iverson began school on 1 April 1926 in a  one-room school , [4]  initially in Grade 1, promoted to Grade 2 after 3 months and to Grade 4 by the end of June 1927.
He left school after Grade 9 because it was the depths of the  Great Depression  and there was work to do on the  family farm , and because he thought further schooling only led to becoming a schoolteacher and he had no desire to become one.  At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with  De Forest Training  in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook. [4] [6] 
During  World War II , while serving in the  Royal Canadian Air Force , he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma.
After the war, Iverson enrolled in  Queen's University  in  Kingston, Ontario , taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would "beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity". [4]  He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a  Bachelor's degree  in  mathematics  and  physics . [3] 
Continuing his education at  Harvard University , he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a  Master's degree  in 1951.  He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with  Howard Aiken  and  Wassily Leontief .
Kenneth Iverson has recalled graduate study under Aiken as "like an apprenticeship" in which the student "learned the tools of the scholarship trade". Every topic was "used more as a focus for the development of skills such as clarity of thought and expression than as an end in itself". Once admitted to the program, a graduate student underwent a rite of "adoption into the fold". He was given a desk (or a share of a desk) among a group of other graduate students, the permanent staff, or visiting scholars, "most of whom were engaged in some aspect of the design and building of computers". A student was thus "made to feel part of a scholarly enterprise" and was provided, "often for the first time, with easy and intimate access to others more experienced in his chosen field".When interviewing Aiken, I had asked him whether Tropp and I might see his lecture notes; Aiken replied that he had always destroyed his lecture notes at the end of each year, so that he would not be tempted to repeat his lectures.Howard Aiken had developed the  Harvard Mark I , one of the first large-scale digital computers, while  Wassily Leontief  was an economist who was developing the  input–output model  of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the  Nobel prize . Leontief's model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the  Harvard Mark IV  computer. Iverson received a  Ph.D.  in  applied mathematics  in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work. [9] [10] 
At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time  Putnam Fellow  and fellow graduate student from Alberta. [11] [12]   This had future ramifications.
Iverson stayed on at Harvard as an  assistant professor  to implement the world's first graduate program in "automatic data processing". [15] [16] [17] 
Many people think that Aiken was interested only in  scientific  computers. This was simply not so. During one coffee hour, Aiken turned to Ken Iverson, who had just finished his Ph.D., and said: "These machines are going to be immensely important for business, and I want you to prepare and teach a course in business data processing next fall." There had never been such a course anywhere in the world. Ken was qualified only because he was a mathematician. I was so excited by the prospect that I immediately volunteered to be Ken's graduate teaching assistant.It was in this period that Iverson developed notation for describing and analyzing various topics in data processing, for teaching classes, and for writing (with Brooks)  Automatic Data Processing . [18]  He was "appalled" to find that conventional mathematical notation failed to fill his needs, and began work on extensions to the notation that were more suitable.  In particular, he adopted the matrix algebra used in his thesis work, the systematic use of matrices and higher-dimensional arrays in  tensor  analysis, and operators in the sense of  Heaviside  in his treatment of  Maxwell's equations ,  higher-order functions  on function argument(s) with a function result. [4]   The notation was also field-tested in the business world in 1957 during a 6-month sabbatical spent at  McKinsey & Company . [4] [19]  The first published paper using the notation was  The Description of Finite Sequential Processes , initially Report Number 23 to  Bell Labs  and later revised and presented at the Fourth London Symposium on Information Theory in August 1960. [13] [20] 
Iverson stayed at Harvard for five years but failed to get tenure, because "[he hadn't] published anything but the one little book". [3] 
Iverson joined  IBM Research  in 1960 (and doubled his salary). [4]  He was preceded to IBM by  Fred Brooks , who advised him to "stick to whatever [he] really wanted to do, because management was so starved for ideas that anything not clearly crazy would find support." In particular, he was allowed to finish and publish  A Programming Language [20] [21]  and (with Brooks)  Automatic Data Processing , [18]  two books that described and used the notation developed at Harvard.  ( Automatic Data Processing  and  A Programming Language  began as one book "but the material grew in both magnitude and level until a separation proved wise". [18] [21] )
At IBM, Iverson soon met  Adin Falkoff , and they worked together for the next twenty years.  Chapter 2 of  A Programming Language  used Iverson's notation to describe the  IBM 7090  computer. [20] [21]   In early 1963 Falkoff, later joined by Iverson and  Ed Sussenguth , proceeded to use the notation to produce a formal description of the  IBM System/360  computer then under design. [22]  The result was published in 1964 in a double issue of the IBM Systems Journal, [23]  thereafter known as the "grey book" or "grey manual". The book was used in a course on computer systems design at the IBM Systems Research Institute. [23]  A consequence of the formal description was that it attracted the interest of bright young minds. [4] [24]  One hotbed of interest was at  Stanford University  which included  Larry Breed ,  Phil Abrams ,  Roger Moore ,  Charles Brenner , [25]  and Mike Jenkins, [26] [27]  all of whom later made contributions to APL. Donald McIntyre, head of geology at  Pomona College  which had the first general customer installation of a 360 system, used the formal description to become more expert than the IBM systems engineer assigned to Pomona. [4] [28] 
With the completion of the formal description Falkoff and Iverson turned their attention to implementation. This work was brought to rapid fruition in 1965 when  Larry Breed  and  Phil Abrams  joined the project.  They produced a FORTRAN-based implementation on the 7090 called IVSYS (for Iverson system) by autumn 1965, first in batch mode and later, in early 1966, in time-shared interactive mode. [25] [29] [30]  Subsequently, Breed,  Dick Lathwell  (ex  University of Alberta ), and Roger Moore (of  I. P. Sharp Associates ) produced the System/360 implementation; [31]  the three received the  Grace Murray Hopper Award  in 1973 "for their work in the design and implementation of APL\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems." [32]  While the 360 implementation work was underway "Iverson notation" [30] [33]  was renamed "APL", by Falkoff. [34]  The workspace "1 cleanspace" was saved at 1966-11-27 22.53.58  UTC . [24]  APL\360 service began within IBM several weeks before that [35]  and outside IBM in 1968. [29]  Additional information on the implementation of APL\360 can be found in the Acknowledgements of the  APL\360 User's Manual [36]  and in "Appendix. Chronology of APL development" of  The Design of APL . [22] 
The formal description and especially the implementation drove the evolution of the language, a process of consolidation and regularization in typography, linearization, syntax, and function definition described in  APL\360 History , [39]   The Design of APL , [22]  and  The Evolution of APL . [19]  Two treatises from this period,  Conventions Governing the Order of Evaluation [40]  and  Algebra as a Language , [41]  are apologias of APL notation.
The notation was used by Falkoff and Iverson to teach various topics at various universities and at the IBM Systems Research Institute. [22] [39]  In 1964 Iverson used the notation in a one-semester course for seniors at the  Fox Lane High School , [34] [42]  and later in  Swarthmore High School . [4]  After APL became available its first application was to teach formal methods in systems design at  NASA Goddard . [39] [43]  It was also used at the  Hotchkiss School , [25]   Lower Canada College , [44]   Scotch Plains High School , [45]  Atlanta public schools, [46] [47]  among others. In one school the students became so eager that they broke into the school after hours to get more APL computer time; [24] [48]  in another the APL enthusiasts steered newbies to  BASIC  so as to maximize their own APL time. [25] 
In 1969, Iverson and the APL group inaugurated the IBM Philadelphia Scientific Center. [29] [39]  In 1970 he was named  IBM Fellow . [49]  He used the funding that came with being an IBM Fellow to bring in visiting teachers and professors from various fields, including Donald McIntyre from  Pomona [28]  and  Jeff Shallit  as a summer student. [24]  For a period of several months the visitors would start using APL for expositions in their own fields, and the hope was that later they would continue their use of APL at their home institutions. [50]  Iverson's work at this time centered in several disciplines, including collaborative projects in circuit theory, genetics, geology, and calculus. [51] [52] [53] [54]  When the PSC closed in 1974, [29] [34]  some of the group transferred to California while others including Iverson remained in the East, later transferring back to IBM Research. He received the  Turing Award  in 1979. [1] 
The following table lists the publications which Iverson authored or co-authored while he was at IBM. They reflect the two main strands of his work.
In 1980, Iverson left IBM for  I. P. Sharp Associates , [79] [80]  an APL  time-sharing  company.  He was preceded there by his IBM colleagues Paul Berry, Joey Tuttle,  Dick Lathwell , and  Eugene McDonnell .  At IPSA, the APL language and systems group was managed by Eric Iverson (Ken Iverson's son);  Roger Moore , one of the APL\360 implementers, was a vice president.
Iverson worked to develop and extend APL on the lines presented in  Operators and Functions . [73] [81]  The language work gained impetus in 1981 when  Arthur Whitney  and Iverson produced a model of APL written in APL [82] [83]  at the same time they were working on IPSA's  OAG  database. [3] [12] [84]  (Iverson introduced Arthur Whitney, son of Eoin Whitney, to APL when he was 11-years-old [12]  and in 1974 recommended him for a summer student position at IPSA  Calgary . [24] ) In the model, the APL syntax was driven by an 11-by-5 table.  Whitney also invented the  rank operator  in the process. [85]  The language design was further simplified and extended in  Rationalized APL [86]  in January 1983, multiple editions of  A Dictionary of the APL Language  between 1984 and 1987, and  A Dictionary of APL [87]  in September 1987. Within IPSA, the phrase "dictionary APL" came into use to denote the APL specified by  A Dictionary of APL , itself referred to as "the dictionary".  In the dictionary, APL syntax is controlled by a 9-by-6 table and the parsing process was precisely and succinctly described in Table 2, and there is a primitive (monadic ⊥, modeled in APL) for word formation ( lexing ).
In the 1970s and 1980s, the main APL vendors were  IBM ,  STSC , and  IPSA , and all three were active in developing and extending the language. IBM had APL2, based on the work of  Jim Brown . [88] [89] [90]  Work on APL2 proceeded intermittently for 15 years, [29]  with actual coding starting in 1971 and APL2 becoming available as an IUP (Installed User Program, an IBM product classification) in 1982. STSC had an experimental APL system called NARS, designed and implemented by Bob Smith. [91] [92]  NARS and APL2 differed in fundamental respects from dictionary APL, [93]  and differed from each other.
I.P. Sharp implemented the new APL ideas in stages: complex numbers, [94]  enclosed (boxed) arrays, match, and composition operators in 1981, [95]  the determinant operator in 1982, [96]  and the rank operator, link, and the left and right identity functions in 1983. [97]  However, the domains of operators were still restricted to the primitive functions or subsets thereof. In 1986, IPSA developed SAX, [77] [98]  SHARP APL/Unix, written in C and based on an implementation by  STSC . The language was as specified in the dictionary with no restrictions on the domains of operators.  An alpha version of SAX became available within I.P. Sharp around December 1986 or early 1987.
In education, Iverson developed  A SHARP APL Minicourse [99] [100]  used to teach IPSA clients in the use of APL, and  Applied Mathematics for Programmers [101]  and  Mathematics and Programming [102]  which were used in computer science courses at  T.H. Twente .
Publications which Iverson authored or co-authored while he was at  I. P. Sharp Associates :
Iverson retired from I. P. Sharp Associates in 1987.  He kept busy while "between jobs".  Regarding language design, the most significant of his activities in this period was the invention of "fork" in 1988. [111]   For years, he had struggled to find a way to write f+g as in calculus, from the "scalar operators" in 1978, [73]  through the "til" operator in 1982, [82] [86]  the catenation and reshape operators in 1984, [106]  the union and intersection operators in 1987, [87]  "yoke" in 1988, [112]  and finally forks in 1988. Forks are defined as follows:
Moreover, (f g p q r) ←→ (f g (p q r)). Thus to write f+g as in calculus, one can write f+g in APL. Iverson and  Eugene McDonnell  worked out the details on the long plane rides to the APL88 conference in Sydney, Australia, with Iverson coming up with the initial idea on waking up from a nap. [85] [113] [81] : §1.3, §3.8  
Iverson presented the rationale for his work post 1987 as follows: [16] 
When I retired from paid employment, I turned my attention back to this matter [the use of APL for teaching] and soon concluded that the essential tool required was a dialect of APL that:

The result has been  J , first reported in [the  APL 90 Conference Proceedings ]. [114]Roger Hui  described the final impetus that got J started in Appendix A of  An Implementation of J : [115] 
One summer weekend in 1989,  Arthur Whitney  visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced—on one page and in one afternoon—an interpreter fragment on the  AT&T 3B1 computer . I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style; and on Sunday, August 27, 1989, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document.
Arthur's one-page interpreter fragment is as follows: ...Hui, a classmate of Whitney at the  University of Alberta , had studied  A Dictionary of the APL Language  when  he  was between jobs, [4]  modelled the parsing process in at least two different ways, [85]  and investigated uses of dictionary APL in diverse applications. [116]  As well, from January 1987 to August 1989 he had access to SAX, [77]  and in the later part of that period used it on a daily basis. [85] 
J initially took  A Dictionary of APL [87]  as the specification, and the J interpreter was built around Table 2 of the dictionary. The C data and program structures were designed so that the parse table in C corresponded directly to the parse table in the dictionary. [85]   In retrospect, Iverson's APL87 paper  APL87 , [107]  in five pages, prescribed all the essential steps in writing an APL interpreter, in particular the sections on word formation and parsing.   Arthur Whitney , in addition to the "one-page thing", contributed to J development by suggesting that primitives be oriented on the leading axis, that agreement (a generalization of scalar extension) should be prefix instead of suffix, [117]  and that a total array ordering be defined. [118] 
One of the objectives was to implement fork. This turned out to be rather straightforward, by the inclusion of one additional row in the parse table. The choice to implement forks was fortuitous and fortunate. It was realized only later [119] [120]  that forks made  tacit expressions  (operator expressions) complete in the following sense: any sentence involving one or two arguments that did not use its arguments as an operand, can be written tacitly with fork, compose, the left and right identity functions, and constant functions.
Two obvious differences between J and other APL dialects are: (a) its use of terms from natural languages instead of from mathematics or computer science (the practice began with  A Dictionary of APL ): noun, verb, adverbs, alphabet, word formation, sentence, ... instead of array, function, operator, character set, lexing, expression, ... ; and (b) its use of 7-bit ASCII characters instead of special symbols.  Other differences between J and APL are described in  J for the APL Programmer [121]  and  APL and J . [122] 
The J source code is available from Jsoftware under the  GNU General Public License  version 3 (GPL3), or a commercial alternative. [123] 
Eric Iverson founded Iverson Software Inc., in February 1990 to provide an improved SHARP APL/PC product. It quickly became obvious that there were shared interests and goals, and in May 1990 Iverson and Hui joined Iverson Software Inc.; later joined by Chris Burke. The company soon became J only. The name was changed to Jsoftware Inc., in April 2000. [85]

Surname: Johnson
Awards: 0
Education: Johnson's passion for computing started at age five, when his grandfather took him along to his work at the  Bureau of Standards . The computer he saw ("the size of a small house") made a strong impression on him, and he decided he "wanted to work with computers, and never looked back after". [3] 
There were no computer science classes in college, so he studied mathematics, in which he eventually earned a PhD.
Johnson joined  Bell Labs  and  AT&T  in the 1960s and worked on  Unix  tools for nearly 20 years, alongside computer scientists like  Jeffrey Ullman ,  Dennis Ritchie  and  Alfred Aho . He was best known for writing  Yacc ,  Lint , and the  Portable C Compiler .
In the mid-1970s, Johnson and Bell colleague  Dennis Ritchie  co-authored the first AT&T  Unix  port. They also "demonstrated that Unix was  portable ", which Ritchie considers the spark that led to Unix becoming widespread. [4]  In the mid-1980s, he served as the head of the UNIX Languages Department ( UNIX System V ). [3] 
Johnson developed  Yacc  in the early '70s because he wanted to insert an  exclusive or  operator into Ritchie's  B language  compiler. [5]  Bell Labs colleague  Alfred Aho  suggested he look at  Donald Knuth 's work on  LR parsing , which served as the basis for Yacc. [3]  In a 2008 interview, Johnson reflected that "the contribution Yacc made to the spread of  Unix  and  C  is what I'm proudest of". [2]   Lint  was developed in 1978 while Johnson was debugging the Yacc grammar he was writing for  C  and struggling with  portability  issues stemming from porting  Unix  to a  32-bit  machine. [3] [6] 
In 1986, Johnson moved to  Silicon Valley , where he joined several  startups , where he worked mostly on  compilers , but also 2D and 3D graphics,  massively parallel   computing  and  embedded systems . The startups included  Dana Computer, Inc. , [7]  Melismatic Software, and  Transmeta , which made low-power,  Intel -compatible  microprocessors . [3] 
Johnson served on the  USENIX  board for ten years, including four years as president in the early 1990s. He now serves as the USENIX representative to the  Computing Research Association . [ citation needed ] 
In 2002, he moved to Boston to work at  MathWorks , [8]  where he helped maintain the front end of the  MATLAB  programming language, for which he also built a  lint  product called M-Lint. He had met MathWorks founder  Cleve Moler  while working at a Silicon Valley startup and developed a "long-distance consulting relationship" with him in the 1990s. [3] 
As of 2018 Johnson currently lived in  Morgan Hill, California  busy working on energy-efficient computers for  machine learning  at Wave Computing. [1]

Surname: Kleinrock
Awards: 5
Education: Leonard Kleinrock was born in  New York City  on June 13, 1934, to a  Jewish  family, [3]  and  graduated from the noted  Bronx High School of Science  in 1951. He received a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree in 1957 from the  City College of New York , and a master's degree and a doctorate (Ph.D.) in  electrical engineering  and  computer science  from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT) in 1959 and 1963 respectively. He then joined the faculty at the  University of California at Los Angeles  (UCLA), where he remains to the present day; during 1991–1995 he served as the chairman of the Computer Science Department there. [4] 
Kleinrock's best-known and most-significant work is on  queueing theory , a branch of  operations research  that has applications in many fields. His thesis proposal in 1961 led to a doctoral thesis at MIT in 1962, later published in book form in 1964. In this work, he researched the configuration and operation of communication networks, considering design parameters such as "channel capacity, effect of priority discipline, choice of routing procedure, and design of topological structure". He analyzed delays in  Plan 55-A , a  message switching  system operated by  Western Union  for processing  telegrams . His thesis went on to apply  probability theory  to model queuing delays in a generalized communication network. [5]  Kleinrock later published several of the standard works on the subject in the mid 1970s. [6] [7] 
A contemporary from MIT,  Larry Roberts , brought Leonard Kleinrock into the  ARPANET  project informally in early 1967. [8]  Roberts learned about  packet switching  from a paper written by  Donald Davies , presented at the October 1967  Symposium on Operating Systems Principles , and incorporated the concept into the proposal for the ARPANET. [9] [10]  Kleinrock was awarded a contract in 1969 to measure and model the performance of the network. His mathematical work influenced the development of the early ARPANET. [11] [12] [13]  In addition, Kleinrock managed the software team at UCLA — including  Steve Crocker ,  Jon Postel , and  Vint Cerf  — who developed the host-host protocol for the ARPANET, the  Network Control Program  (NCP).
The first message on the ARPANET was sent by a UCLA student programmer, Charley Kline, who was supervised by Kleinrock. [14] [15]  At 10:30 p.m, on October 29, 1969, from Boelter Hall 3420, the school's main engineering building, [16]  Kline transmitted from the university's  SDS Sigma 7  host computer to the Stanford Research Institute's  SDS 940  host computer. The message text was the word "login"; the "l" and the "o" letters were transmitted, but the system then crashed. Hence, the literal first message over the ARPANET was "lo". About an hour later, having recovered from the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer effected a full "login". The first permanent ARPANET link was established on November 21, 1969, between the  Interface Message Processor  (IMP) at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By December 5, 1969, the initial four-node network was established. [17] [18] 
Kleinrock used the ARPANET for  instant messaging  from the U.S. to Larry Roberts in  England  in 1973, employing the network for a practical every-day use. [19] 
Kleinrock published hundreds of research papers, [20] [21]  which ultimately launched a new field of research on the theory and application of queuing theory to computer networks. [6] [7]  In this role, he supervised the research of scores of graduate students. [21] [22]  He disseminated his research and that of his students to wider audiences for academic and commercial use, and organized hundreds of commercial seminars presented by experts and pioneers in the U.S. and internationally. [22] [21]  Many graduate students that Kleinrock supported based their later careers on expertise they acquired while working on the ARPANET with him. [6]  Kleinrock's work in the 1970s addressed packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, broadband networks, nomadic computing, peer-to-peer networks, and intelligent software agents. [20]  His theoretical work on  hierarchical routing  with student  Farouk Kamoun  remains critical to the operation of the Internet today. [23] [24] 
In 1988, Kleinrock was the chairman of a group that presented the report  Toward a National Research Network  to the  U.S. Congress ,  concluding that "There is a clear and urgent need for a national research network". [25]  Although the U.S. did not build a nationwide  national research and education network , this report  influenced  Al Gore  to pursue the development of the  High Performance Computing Act of 1991 , [26]  which helped facilitate development of the Internet as it is known today. [27]  Funding from the bill was used in the development of the 1993 web browser  Mosaic  at the  National Center for Supercomputing Applications  (NCSA), which accelerated the adoption of the  World Wide Web . [28] [29] 

In 1990, Kleinrock said: [22]The thing that really drove my own research was the idea of a message switching network, which was a precursor to the packet switching networks. The mathematical tool that had been developed in queueing theory, namely queueing networks, matched perfectly the model of computer networks. Actually, it didn't match perfectly and I had to adjust that model to fit the realities of computer networks. Then I developed some design procedures as well for optimal capacity assignment, routing procedures and topology design. 
Beginning in the mid-1990s, Kleinrock sought to be recognized "as the father of modern data networking". [30]  By 1997, he claimed  priority  on the invention of packet switching and to have convinced Larry Roberts to adopt the technique. [31]  In 2004, he described his work as:Basically, what I did for my PhD research in 1961-1962 was to establish a mathematical theory of packet networks which uncovered the underlying principles that drives today's Internet.However, Kleinrock's claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that this work was the source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET are disputed by other Internet pioneers, [30] [32] [33] [34]  including  Robert Taylor , [35]   Paul Baran , [36]  and  Donald Davies . [37]  Historians and the U.S.  National Inventors Hall of Fame  recognize Baran and Davies for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet. [38] [39] [40] [41] 
Kleinrock made several important contributions to the field of computer science, in particular to the theoretical foundations of  data communication  in  computer networking . He has received numerous professional awards. In 1980, he was elected a member of the  National Academy of Engineering  for pioneering contributions to the field and leadership as an educator in computer communications networks. [42]  In 2001 he received the  Draper Prize  "for the development of the Internet". [43]  Kleinrock was selected to receive the prestigious  National Medal of Science , the nation's highest scientific honor, from President George W. Bush in the White House on September 29, 2008. "The 2007 National Medal of Science to Leonard Kleinrock for his fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of modern data networks, and for the functional specification of packet switching, which is the foundation of Internet technology. His mentoring of generations of students has led to the commercialization of technologies that have transformed the world." [1] 
In 2010 he shared the  Dan David Prize . [44]  UCLA Room 3420 at Boelter Hall was restored to its condition of 1969 and converted into the Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive. It opened to the public with a grand opening attended by Internet pioneers on October 29, 2011. [16] [45] 
He was elected as a member into the  National Academy of Engineering . In 2012, Kleinrock was inducted into the  Internet Hall of Fame  by the  Internet Society . [20]  Leonard Kleinrock was inducted into IEEE- Eta Kappa Nu  (IEEE-ΗΚΝ) in 2011 as an Eminent Member.  The designation of Eminent Member is the organization's highest membership grade and is conferred upon those select few whose outstanding technical attainments and contributions through leadership in the fields of electrical and computer engineering have significantly benefited society. He was elected to the 2002 class of  Fellows  of the  Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences . [46]  In September 2014, Leonard Kleinrock was awarded the ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award at MobiCom 2014.

Surname: Knuth
Awards: 14
Education: Knuth received a scholarship in physics to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of  Case Western Reserve University ) in  Cleveland , Ohio, enrolling in 1956. [10]  He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the  Theta Chi fraternity . While studying physics at Case, Knuth was introduced to the  IBM 650 , an early commercial  computer . After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the  assembly  and  compiler  code for the machine used in his school because he believed he could do it better. [11] 
In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win its games. [12]  He assigned "values" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel approach that  Newsweek  and  CBS Evening News  later reported on. [11] 
Knuth was one of the founding editors of the Case Institute's  Engineering and Science Review , which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959. [13] [14]  He then switched from physics to mathematics, and received two degrees from Case in 1960: [10]  his bachelor of science, and simultaneously a master of science by a special award of the faculty, who considered his work exceptionally outstanding. [4] [11] 
In 1963, with mathematician  Marshall Hall  as his adviser, [2]  he earned a PhD in mathematics from the  California Institute of Technology , with a thesis titled  Finite Semifields and Projective Planes . [15] 
In 1963, after receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an assistant professor. [16] 
Knuth accepted a commission to write a book on computer  programming language   compilers . While working on this project, he decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became  The Art of Computer Programming . He originally planned to publish this as a single book, but as he developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968. [17] 
Just before publishing the first volume of  The Art of Computer Programming , Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the  Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division , then situated on the  Princeton  campus, which was performing mathematical research in  cryptography  to support the  National Security Agency . [ citation needed ] 
In 1967, Knuth attended a  Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  conference and someone asked what he did. At the time, computer science was partitioned into  numerical analysis ,  artificial intelligence , and  programming languages . Based on his study and  The Art of Computer Programming  book, Knuth decided the next time someone asked he would say, "Analysis of algorithms". [18] 
In 1969, Knuth left his position at Princeton to join the  Stanford University  faculty, [19]  where he is now  Fletcher Jones  Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus. [20] [21]

Surname: Korn
Awards: 0
Education: David Korn received his undergraduate degree in  mathematics  from  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  in 1965 and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from  NYU 's  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  in 1969. After working on computer simulations of transsonic airfoils and developing the Korn airfoil, [2]  he switched fields to computer science and became a member of technical staff at  Bell Laboratories  in 1976. He developed Korn shell in response to problems he and his colleagues had with the most commonly used shells at the time,  Bourne shell  and  C shell . The Korn shell pioneered the practice of consultative user interface design, with input from Unix shell users, and from mathematical and cognitive psychologists. [ citation needed ]  The user interface, which included a choice of editing styles (the choices included styles based on vi and on two variants of Emacs) was incorporated into, or copied by, most subsequent Unix shells. The Korn shell is  backward-compatible  with Bourne shell, but takes a lot of ideas from C shell, such as history viewing and  vi -like command line editing.

Surname: Lenat
Awards: 6
Education: Lenat was born in  Philadelphia , United States, on September 13, 1950. [14]  When he was 5, the family moved to  Wilmington, Delaware , where his father, Nathan Lenat, owned a  bottling plant . [14]   His father died when he was 13 and the family then returned to Pennsylvania, where he attended  Cheltenham High School . [14]   His after-school job was cleaning rat cages and goose pens at  Beaver College  which motivated him to learn programming as a better occupation. [14] 
He attended the  University of Pennsylvania , supporting himself by programming, including the design and development of a  natural language interface  for a  United States Navy  online  operations manual .  He graduated with  bachelor's degrees  in Mathematics and Physics, and a  master's degree  in Applied Mathematics, all in 1972. [14] 
For his senior thesis, advised in part by  Dennis Gabor , was to bounce acoustic waves in the 40 mHz range off real-world objects, record their interference patterns on a 2-meter square plot, photo-reduce those to a 10-mm square film image, shine a laser through the film, and thus project the three-dimensional imaged object—i.e., the first known acoustic  hologram . [ citation needed ]  To settle an argument with Dr. Gabor, Lenat computer-generated a five-dimensional hologram, by photo-reducing computer printout of the interference pattern of a globe rotating and expanding over time, reducing the large two-dimensional paper printout to a moderately large 5-cm square film surface through which a conventional laser beam was then able to project a three-dimensional image, which changed in two independent ways (rotating and changing in size) as the film was moved up-down or left-right.

Surname: Liedtke
Awards: 0
Education: In the mid-1970s Liedtke studied for a diploma degree in mathematics at the  Bielefeld University . His thesis project was to build a  compiler  for the programming language  ELAN , which had been launched for teaching programming in German schools. [ citation needed ]  The compiler was written in ELAN.
After his graduation in 1977, he remained at Bielefeld and worked on an Elan environment for the  Zilog Z80  microprocessor. This required a  runtime system  (environment), which he named  Eumel  ("Extendable Multiuser Microprocessor ELAN-System", but also a colloquial north-German term for a  likeable fool ). Eumel grew into a complete multi-tasking, multi-user  operating system  supporting  orthogonal persistence , which started shipping ( by whom? to whom? ) in 1980 and was later ported to  Zilog Z8000 ,  Motorola 68000  and  Intel 8086  processors. As these processors lacked memory protection, Eumel implemented a  virtual machine  which added the features missing from the hardware. [1]  More than 2000 Eumel systems shipped, mostly to schools, and some to legal practices as a  text processing  platform.
In 1984, he joined the  Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung  (GMD), the German National Research Center for Computer Science, which is now a part of the  Fraunhofer Society . There, he continued his work on Eumel. In 1987, when microprocessors supporting  virtual memory  became widely available in the form of the  Intel 80386 , Liedtke started to design a new operating system to succeed Eumel, which he called  L3  ("Liedtke's 3rd system", after Eumel and the  ALGOL 60  interpreter he had written in high school). L3 was designed to achieve better performance by using the latest hardware features, and was implemented from scratch. It was mostly backward-compatible with Eumel, thus benefiting from the existing Eumel ecosystem. L3 started to ship in 1989, with total deployment of at least 500. [1] 
Both Eumel and L3 were  microkernel  systems, a popular design in the 1980s. However, by the early 1990s, microkernels had received a bad reputation, as systems built on top were performing poorly, culminating in the billion-dollar failure of the  IBM Workplace OS . The reason was claimed to be inherent in the operating-system structure imposed by microkernels. [2]  Liedtke, however, observed that the message-passing operation (IPC), which is fundamentally important for microkernel performance, was slow in all existing microkernels, including his own L3 system. [3]  His conclusion was that radical redesign was needed. He did this by re-implementing L3 from scratch, dramatically simplifying the kernel, resulting in an order-of-magnitude decrease in IPC cost. [4] 
The resulting kernel was later renamed "L4". Conceptually, the main novelty of L4 was its complete reliance on external pagers ( page fault  handlers), and the recursive construction of address spaces. [5] 
This led to a complete  family of microkernels , with many independent implementations of the same principles.
Liedtke also worked on  computer architecture , inventing guarded  page tables  as a means to implement a sparsely-mapped  64-bit  address space. [6]  In 1996, Liedtke completed a PhD on guarded page tables at the  Technical University of Berlin .
In the same year he joined the  Thomas J. Watson Research Center , where he continued to work on L4, referred to as “Lava Nucleus” (LN) to avoid negative connotations with previously unsuccessful microkernels, such as the one used in  Workplace OS . The main project during his IBM time was the Saw Mill project, which attempted to turn  Linux  into an L4-based multi-server OS.
In April 1999, he took up the System Architecture Chair at the  University of Karlsruhe . There, he continued to collaborate with IBM on Saw Mill, but at the same time worked on a new generation of L4 (version 4). Several experimental kernels were developed during that time, including Hazelnut, the first L4 kernel that was ported (in contrast to re-implemented) to a different architecture (from  x86  to  ARM ). Work on the new version was completed after his death by Liedtke's students Volkmar Uhlig, Uwe Dannowski, and Espen Skoglund. It was released under the name  Pistachio  in 2002.
On Sunday June 10, 2001, he died unexpectedly at  Frankfurt Airport  while returning from  SOSP '01 program committee meeting in  Chateau Lake Louise , having been ill earlier in the year and undergone two surgeries (the conference proceedings were dedicated to his memory). [7]  He is survived by his wife Adelheid.

Surname: Lovelace
Awards: 0
Education: From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, [22]  and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. [38]  Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by  William Frend ,  William King , [a]  and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician  Augustus De Morgan  extended her "much help in her mathematical studies" including study of advanced calculus topics including the " numbers of Bernoulli " (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine). [39]  In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence". [40] 
Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying  differential calculus , she wrote to De Morgan:
I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in  one  shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar. [41]Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued  metaphysics  as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring "the unseen worlds around us". [42] 
Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852, [43]  from  uterine cancer . [44]  The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. [45]  She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him. [46]  She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the  Church of St. Mary Magdalene  in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque, written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers. [ citation needed ]

Surname: McCarthy
Awards: 7
Education: John McCarthy was born in  Boston, Massachusetts , on September 4, 1927, to an  Irish  immigrant father and a  Lithuanian Jewish  immigrant mother, [4]  John Patrick and Ida (Glatt) McCarthy. The family was obliged to relocate frequently during the  Great Depression , until McCarthy's father found work as an organizer for the  Amalgamated Clothing Workers  in  Los Angeles, California . His father came from  Cromane , a small fishing village in  County Kerry , Ireland. [5]  His mother died in 1957. [6] 
Both parents were active members of the  Communist Party  during the 1930s, and they encouraged learning and critical thinking. Before he attended high school, he got interested in science by reading a translation of a Russian popular science book for children, called  100,000 Whys . [7]   John was fluent in the  Russian language  and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to the  Soviet Union  but he distanced himself after making visits to the  Soviet Bloc , which led to him becoming a  conservative   Republican . [8] 
McCarthy graduated from  Belmont High School  two years early. [9]  McCarthy was accepted into Caltech in 1944.
McCarthy showed an early aptitude for  mathematics ; during his teens he taught himself college mathematics by studying the textbooks used at the nearby  California Institute of Technology  (Caltech). As a result, he was able to skip the first two years of mathematics at Caltech. [10] 
McCarthy was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend  physical education  courses. [11]  He then served in the  US Army  and was readmitted, receiving a  BS  in  mathematics  in 1948. [12] 
It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by  John von Neumann  that inspired his future endeavors.
McCarthy initially completed graduate studies at Caltech before moving to  Princeton University . He received a  PhD  in mathematics from Princeton in 1951 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled " Projection operators  and  partial differential equations ", under the supervision of  Donald C. Spencer . [13]

Surname: Moon
Awards: 0
Education: Moon's best subjects in school were  Mathematics ,  Science  and  English .  After he graduated high school with honors, he enrolled at  Pennsylvania State University  where he received a degree in  mechanical engineering  in 1960. After graduating from there he decided to further pursue his education and get his masters from  New York University  (NYU) where he continued his studies in engineering.
During the 1960s major companies started recruiting African Americans to work with and for them due to the change of the race relations and they were responding to the demands that the Civil Rights Movement put on government and businesses suggesting that there should be equal opportunities for all. Moon was hired at  IBM  (International Business Machines) in  New York City  through a program that was hiring African Americans who have experience in the math and science fields; particularly engineers. Though Moon knew very little about computers when he began his career at IBM he thrived throughout the remainder of his time there. He was hired when computer technology was changing rapidly. He joined other IBM scientists in physics, electrical and mechanical engineering and chemistry who were looking at ways to better computers and how they function. He left IBM in 1970.
In 1970, Moon established the  National Micronetics Corporation  with a few other engineers in a garage.  There, they researched ways to use a magnetic substance called  ferrite . From there, he and his colleagues found a way to make ferrite recording heads which were in high demand. Within a couple years their business grew from five people working in a garage to a multimillion-dollar company. Four years later, he moved to  California  where he worked for several different technology companies.
In 1976, he started working with  Tandon Magnetics  Corporation. [2]  The double side disc that could save more data was invented by  Jugi Tandon , and Moon contributed to the success of this product by finding a new way to manufacture this new technological advance by making these ferrite recording heads through mass production rather than one at a time. The implication of Moon's mass production brought a lot of money to the company.
Moon moved to Apple Computers ( Apple Inc. ) in 1980. [3]  Around this time, Apple Computers were the leading personal computer company. Though they had already been making over $100 million. To further their success Apple hired Moon to help the company design and make its own floppy disks and disk drives of which several were designed himself.  Moon became Vice President of the Apple Computer Products division. [4]

Surname: Moore
Awards: 9
Education: Gordon Moore was born in 1929 as the second son of Walter Harold Moore (a county sheriff stationed in  San Mateo County ) and Florence Almira "Mira" Williamson (a homemaker). [9]  When Moore started school in 1935, the faculty noted his introverted personality. [10]  His father accepted a promotion to deputy sheriff in 1938 and moved the family to  Redwood City, California . [11]  In 1940, Moore received a chemistry set as a Christmas gift, which inspired him to become a chemist. [12]  From 1942 to 1946, Moore studied at  Sequoia High School , where he was involved in athletic activities. [13]  From 1946 to 1947, Moore attended  San José State College (now San José State University) , studying chemistry. [14]  He transferred to  University of California, Berkeley  in 1948, taking courses from  Glenn Seaborg ,  Melvin Calvin , and  William Giauque . He graduated in 1950 with a  Bachelor of Science  degree in chemistry. [15] [16] 
In September 1950, Moore enrolled at the  California Institute of Technology  ("Caltech"), where he would ultimately receive a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1954. [17] [16] [18] [19]  Moore conducted  postdoctoral research  at the  Applied Physics Laboratory  at  Johns Hopkins University  from 1953 to 1956. [16] 
Moore joined  MIT  and Caltech alumnus  William Shockley  at the  Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory  division of  Beckman Instruments , but left with the " traitorous eight ," when  Sherman Fairchild  agreed to back them and created the influential  Fairchild Semiconductor  corporation. [20] [21] 
In 1965, Moore was working as the director of research and development (R&D) at Fairchild Semiconductor. He was asked by  Electronics Magazine  to predict what he thought might happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years. In an article published on April 19, 1965, Moore observed that the number of components (transistors, resistors, diodes, or capacitors) [22]  in a dense integrated circuit had doubled approximately every year and speculated that it would continue to do so for at least the next ten years. In 1975, he revised the forecast rate to approximately every two years. [23]   Carver Mead  popularized the phrase "Moore's law". The prediction has become a target for  miniaturization  in the semiconductor industry and has had widespread impact in many areas of technological change. [4] [21] 
In July 1968,  Robert Noyce  and Moore founded NM Electronics, which later became  Intel Corporation . [24] [25]  Moore served as executive vice president until 1975 when he became president. In April 1979, Moore became chairman and chief executive officer, holding that position until April 1987, when he became chairman. He was named chairman emeritus in 1997. [26]  Under Noyce, Moore, and later  Andrew Grove , Intel pioneered new technologies for  computer memory ,  integrated circuits , and  microprocessor  design. [25]  On April 11, 2022, Intel renamed its main Oregon site, the Ronler Acres campus in  Hillsboro , as 'Gordon Moore Park', and the building formerly known as RA4, as 'Moore Center', after Gordon Moore. [27] 
As of February 2023, Moore's  net worth  was reported to be $7 billion. [28] 
In 2000, Moore and his wife established the  Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , with a gift worth about $5 billion. Through the foundation, they initially targeted environmental conservation, science, and the San Francisco Bay Area. [29] 
The foundation gives extensively in the area of environmental conservation, supporting major projects in the Andes–Amazon Basin, including Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela and Suriname, as well as the San Francisco Bay area. [30] [31]  Moore was a director of  Conservation International  for some years. In 2002, he and  Conservation International  senior vice president Claude Gascon received the  Order of the Golden Ark  from  Prince Bernhard  of the Netherlands for their outstanding contributions to nature conservation. [32] 
Moore was a member of Caltech's board of trustees from 1983, chairing it from 1993 to 2000, and was a life trustee at the time of his death. [33] [34] [35]  In 2001, Moore and his wife donated $600 million to Caltech, at the time the largest gift ever to an institution of higher education. [36]  He said he wanted the gift to be used to keep Caltech at the forefront of research and technology. [29] 
In December 2007, Moore and his wife donated $200 million to Caltech and the  University of California  for the construction of the  Thirty Meter Telescope  (TMT), expected to become the world's second largest optical telescope once it and the  European Extremely Large Telescope  are completed in the mid-2020s. The TMT will have a segmented mirror 30 meters across and be built on  Mauna Kea  in Hawaii. This mirror will be nearly three times the size of the current record holder, the  Large Binocular Telescope . [37] 
The Moores, as individuals and through their  foundation , have also, in a series of gifts and grants beginning in the 1990s, given some $166 million to the  University of California, Berkeley  to fund initiatives ranging from materials science and physics to genomics and data science. [38] [39] [40] 
In addition, through the foundation, his wife created the Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative, targeting nursing care in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Sacramento. [29] [41]   In 2007, the foundation pledged $100 million over 11 years to establish a nursing school at the  University of California, Davis . [38]   The Moores have also been long-time benefactors of other Northern California institutions, including  Stanford University  (over $190 million as of 2022),  University of California, San Francisco , and  University of California, Santa Cruz . [38] 
In 2009, the Moores received the  Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy . [29] [42] 
Moore received many honors. He was elected a member of the  National Academy of Engineering  in 1976 for contributions to semiconductor devices from transistors to microprocessors. [43] 
In 1990, Moore was presented with the  National Medal of Technology and Innovation  by President  George H. W. Bush , "for his seminal leadership in bringing American industry the two major postwar innovations in microelectronics – large-scale integrated memory and the microprocessor – that have fueled the information revolution". [44] 
In 1998, he was inducted as a Fellow of the  Computer History Museum  "for his fundamental early work in the design and production of semiconductor devices as co-founder of Fairchild and Intel". [45] 
In 2001, Moore received the  Othmer Gold Medal  for outstanding contributions to progress in chemistry and science. [46] [47]  Moore was also the recipient of the  Presidential Medal of Freedom , the United States' highest civilian honor, as of 2002. [48]  He received the award from President  George W. Bush . [49]  In 2002, Moore received the  Bower Award  for Business Leadership. [50] 
In 2003 Moore was elected a  Fellow  of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science . He was elected to the  American Philosophical Society  in 2005. [51] 
Moore was awarded the 2008  IEEE Medal of Honor  for "pioneering technical roles in integrated-circuit processing, and leadership in the development of MOS memory, the microprocessor computer, and the semiconductor industry". [52]  Moore was featured in the 2011 documentary film  Something Ventured , in which he said about Intel's first business plan, "It was one page, double spaced. It had a lot of typos in it." [53] 
In 2009, Moore was inducted into the  National Inventors Hall of Fame . He was awarded the 2010  Dan David Prize  for his work in the areas of Computers and Telecommunications. [54] 
The library at the  Centre for Mathematical Sciences  at the  University of Cambridge  is named after him and his wife Betty, [55]  as are the Moore Laboratories building (dedicated 1996) at Caltech and the Gordon and Betty Moore Materials Research Building at Stanford.  The Electrochemical Society  presents an award in Moore's name, the  Gordon E. Moore Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Solid State Science and Technology , biennially to celebrate scientists' contributions to the field of solid-state science. [56]  The  Society of Chemical Industry (American Section)  annually presents the Gordon E. Moore Medal, to recognize early career success in innovation in the chemical industries. [57] [58] 
Moore was awarded the  UCSF  medal in 2016. [59] 
Moore met his wife, Betty Irene Whitaker, in 1947 during a student government conference at the  Asilomar Conference Grounds . [60]  They married in 1950, [61]  and Moore became a father to two sons: Kenneth Moore (b. 1954) and Steven Moore (b. 1959). [62] 
Moore was an avid fisherman since childhood, and he traveled extensively with his wife, sons, or fellow colleagues to catch species such as bass, marlin, salmon, and trout. [63]  He said his conservation efforts were partly inspired by his interest in fishing and his time spent outdoors. [64] 
In 2011, Moore's was the first human genome sequenced on  Ion Torrent 's  Personal Genome  Machine platform, a massively parallel sequencing device, which uses  ISFET   biosensors . [65] 

Moore died at his home in  Hawaii  on March 24, 2023, at age 94. [66]

Surname: Neumann
Awards: 3
Education: Von Neumann was born in  Budapest ,  Kingdom of Hungary  (which was then part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire ), [13] [14] [15]  on December 28, 1903, to a wealthy, acculturated, and non-observant  Jewish  family. His Hungarian birth name was Neumann János Lajos. In Hungarian, the family name comes first, and his given names are equivalent to John Louis in English. [16] 
He was the eldest of three brothers; his two younger siblings were Mihály (English: Michael von Neumann; 1907–1989) and Miklós (Nicholas von Neumann, 1911–2011). [17]  His father, Neumann Miksa (Max von Neumann, 1873–1928) was a banker, who held a  doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from  Pécs  at the end of the 1880s. [18]  Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of  Szerencs ),  Zemplén County , northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann); [19]  her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels of the  Meisels family . [20]  Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor. [21] 
On February 20, 1913,  Emperor Franz Joseph  elevated John's father to the Hungarian nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. [22]  The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation  Margittai , meaning "of Margitta" (today  Marghita ,  Romania ). The family had no connection with the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was their chosen  coat of arms  depicting three  marguerites . Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann de Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann. [23] 
Von Neumann was a  child prodigy  who at six years old could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head [24] [25]  and could converse in  Ancient Greek . When the six-year-old von Neumann caught his mother staring aimlessly, he asked her, "What are you calculating?" [26] 
When they were young, von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins were instructed by governesses. Von Neumann's father believed that knowledge of languages other than their native  Hungarian  was essential, so the children were tutored in  English ,  French ,  German  and  Italian . [27]  By the age of eight, von Neumann was familiar with  differential  and  integral calculus , and by twelve he had read and understood  Borel's  Théorie des Fonctions. [28]  He was also interested in history, reading his way through  Wilhelm Oncken 's 46-volume world history series  Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen  ( General History in Monographs ). [29]  One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor. [30] 
Von Neumann entered the Lutheran  Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium  in 1914. [31]   Eugene Wigner  was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School and soon became his friend. [32] 
Although von Neumann's father insisted that he attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give von Neumann advanced instruction. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst  Gábor Szegő . [32]  By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of  ordinal numbers , which superseded  Georg Cantor 's definition. [33]  At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, he applied for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national award for mathematics. [34] 
According to his friend  Theodore von Kármán , von Neumann's father wanted John to follow him into industry, and asked von Kármán to persuade his son not to take mathematics as his major. [35]  Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was  chemical engineering . This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year, non-degree course in chemistry at the  University of Berlin , after which he sat for the entrance exam to   ETH Zurich , [36]  which he passed in September 1923. [37]  Simultaneously von Neumann also entered  Pázmány Péter University  in Budapest, [38]  as a  Ph.D.  candidate in  mathematics . For his thesis, he produced an  axiomatization  of  Cantor's set theory . [39] [40]  He graduated as a  chemical engineer  from ETH Zurich in 1926, and passed his final examinations  summa cum laude  for his Ph.D. in mathematics (with minors in  experimental physics  and chemistry) simultaneous with his chemical engineering degree. [41] [42]   He then went to the  University of Göttingen  on a grant from the  Rockefeller Foundation  to study mathematics under  David Hilbert . [43]   Hermann Weyl , in his obituary of  Emmy Noether , remembers how in the winter of 1926-1927 von Neumann, Noether, and he would take walks after his classes through "the cold, wet, rain-wet streets of Göttingen" discussing  hypercomplex number  systems and their  representations .

Education: Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in  Chelsea, London ,  England , to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897. [4]  His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of  Bromberg  (now in  Poland ), who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15. [12]  Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann Pike, an Irish schoolteacher, in 1896. [1] 
The family moved to  Dulwich  in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then  City of London School  from 1908. [1] [13]  At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well. [14] 
Newman won a scholarship to study mathematics at  St John's College, Cambridge  in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the  Cambridge Mathematical Tripos . [4]

Surname: Ng
Awards: 9
Education: In 2011, Stanford launched a total of three  massive open online course  (MOOCs) on machine learning (CS229a),  databases , and AI, taught by Ng,  Peter Norvig ,  Sebastian Thrun , and  Jennifer Widom . [45] [46]  This has led to the modern MOOC movement. Ng taught machine learning and Widom taught databases. The course on AI taught by Thrun led to the genesis of  Udacity . [45]   Coursera  was the 6th online education website that Ng built and arguably the most successful to date. [47]But we learned and learned and learned from the early prototypes, until in 2011 we managed to build something that really took off. [47] The seeds of massive open online courses (MOOCs) go back a few years before the founding of Coursera in 2012. Two themes emphasized in the founding of modern MOOCs were  scale  and  availability . [45] 
Ng started the  Stanford Engineering Everywhere  (SEE) program, which in 2008 published a number of Stanford courses online for free. Ng taught one of these courses, "Machine Learning", which includes his video lectures, along with the student materials used in the Stanford CS229 class. It offered a similar experience to  MIT OpenCourseWare , except it aimed at providing a more "complete course" experience, equipped with lectures, course materials, problems and solutions, etc. The SEE videos were viewed by the millions and inspired Ng to develop and iterate new versions of online tech. [45] 
Within Stanford, they include  Daphne Koller  with her "blended learning experiences" and codesigning a peer-grading system, John Mitchell (Courseware, a  Learning Management System ),  Dan Boneh  (using machine learning to sync videos, later teaching  cryptography  on Coursera),  Bernd Girod  (ClassX), and others. Outside Stanford, Ng and Thrun credit  Sal Khan  of  Khan Academy  as a huge source of inspiration. Ng was also inspired by  lynda.com  and the design of the forums of  Stack Overflow . [45] 
Widom, Ng, and others were ardent advocates of Khan-styled tablet recordings, and between 2009 and 2011, several hundred hours of lecture videos recorded by Stanford instructors were recorded and uploaded. Ng tested some of the original designs with a local high school to figure the best practices for recording lessons. [45] 
In October 2011, the "applied" version of the Stanford class (CS229a) was hosted on ml-class.org and launched, with over 100,000 students registered for its first edition. The course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first and most successful massive open online courses (MOOCs) created by a Stanford professor. [48] 
Two other courses on databases (db-class.org) and AI (ai-class.org) were launched. The ml-class and db-class ran on a platform developed by students, including Frank Chen, Jiquan Ngiam, Chuan-Yu Foo, and Yifan Mai. Word spread through social media and popular press. The three courses were 10 weeks long, and over 40,000 "Statements of Accomplishment" were awarded. [45] 

Ng tells the following story on the early days of Coursera:In 2011, I was working with four Stanford students. We were under tremendous pressure to build new features for the 100,000+ students that were already signed up. One of the students (Frank Chen) claims another one (Jiquan Ngiam) frequently stranded him in the Stanford building and refused to give him a ride back to his dorm until very late at night so he had no choice but to stick around and keep working. I neither confirm nor deny this story. [47] His work subsequently led to his founding of Coursera with Koller in 2012. As of 2019, the two most popular courses on the platform were taught and designed by Ng: "Machine Learning" (#1) and "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (#2).
In 2019, Ng launched a new course "AI for Everyone". This is a non-technical course designed to help people understand AI's impact on society and its benefits and costs for companies, as well as how they can navigate through this  technological revolution . [49]

Education: Nilsson was born in  Saginaw ,  Michigan , in 1933. [2]  He received his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1958, and spent much of his career at  SRI International , a private research lab spun off from Stanford. [2] [3] 
Nilsson served as a  lieutenant  in the  U.S. Air Force  from 1958 to 1961; he was stationed at the  Rome Air Development Center  in  Rome ,  New York . [2] [3] 
Starting in 1966, Nilsson, along with  Charles A. Rosen  and  Bertram Raphael , led a research team in the construction of  Shakey , a robot that constructed a model of its environment from sensor data, reasoned about that environment to arrive at a plan of action, then carried that plan out by sending commands to its motors. [2] [3]  This paradigm has been enormously influential in AI. [2] [3]  Textbooks such as  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence , [4]   Essentials of Artificial Intelligence , [5]  and the first edition of  Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach [6]  show this influence in almost every chapter. [2] [3]  Although the basic idea of using logical reasoning to decide on actions is due to John McCarthy, [7]  Nilsson's group was the first to embody it in a complete agent, along the way inventing the  A* search algorithm [8]  and founding the field of  automated temporal planning . [2] [3]  In the latter pursuit, they invented the  STRIPS  planner, [9]  whose action representation is still the basis of many of today's planning algorithms. The subfield of automated temporal planning called  classical planning  is based on most of the assumptions built into STRIPS. [2] [3] 
In 1985, Nilsson became a faculty member at  Stanford University , in the Computer Science Department. [3]  He was chair of the department from 1985 to 1990. [3]  He was the Kumagai Professor of Engineering  from the foundation of the Chair in around 1991 [10]  until his retirement, and remained Kumagai Professor Emeritus until his death. [3] 
He was the fourth President of the  AAAI  (1982–83) and a Founding Fellow of that organization. [3]  Nilsson wrote or coauthored several books on AI, including two that have been especially widely read -  Principles of Artificial Intelligence  (1982) and  Logical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence  (1987). [2] [3] 
In 2011, Nilsson was inducted into  IEEE Intelligent Systems ' AI's Hall of Fame for the "significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems". [ citation needed ] 
On July 19, 1958, Nilsson married Karen Braucht, with whom he had two children. [2] [3]  Braucht died in 1991. [2]  In 1992 he married Grace Abbott, who had four children from a previous marriage. [2] 
Nilsson died on April 23, 2019, at his home in  Medford ,  Oregon , at the age of 86. [2] [3]

In summer school, he attended  Interlochen Center for the Arts  at  Interlochen, Michigan , playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summers.
Page received a  Bachelor of Science  in a major in  computer engineering  with honors from the  University of Michigan  in 1995 and a  Master of Science  in  computer science  from  Stanford University  in 1998. [33] [34] [35] [36] 
While at the University of Michigan, Page created an  inkjet printer  made of  Lego  bricks (literally a  line plotter ), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—Page reverse-engineered the  ink cartridge  and built the electronics and mechanics to drive it. [27]  Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the  Eta Kappa Nu  honor society, [37]  and was a member of the  1993 "Maize & Blue" University of Michigan Solar Car  team. [38]  As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a  personal rapid-transit system , which is essentially a driverless  monorail  with separate cars for every passenger.

Surname: Pal
Awards: 5
Education: SK Pal studied at the  University of Calcutta  for his BSc in physics (1969), and BTech (1972) and MTech (1974) in  radio physics  and  electronics . 
He received a  PhD  in  radio physics  and  electronics  from the  Rajabazar Science College  campus of University of Calcutta in 1979 as a student of  Indian Statistical Institute , and another  PhD  in  electrical engineering  along with Diploma of the Imperial College from  Imperial College ,  University of London , in 1982. After completing PhD at Imperial College, London as a  Commonwealth Scholar , he did post-doctoral research there during 1982 to 1983 as a UK Medical Research Council Fellow. Subsequently, he worked at the  University of California, Berkeley  and  University of Maryland, College Park  from 1986 to 1987 as  Fulbright Fellow ,  NASA Johnson Space Center  from 1990 to 1992 and in 1994 as US NAS-NRC Senior Research Associate, and  US Naval Research Laboratory ,  Washington, D.C.  in 2004 as a visiting scientist. Besides, he had been a Distinguished Visitor of  IEEE Computer Society  (USA) for Asia-Pacific Region since 1997, and held several visiting positions in Australia, Poland, Italy, France, New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong universities. 
Pal joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, as the  CSIR  Senior Research Fellow in 1975, and eventually entered into full professor position in 1987. He then became distinguished scientist in 1998, director in 2005, and president in 2022. He was the first computer scientist as well as someone outside statistics and mathematics to become the director of ISI in its 75-year history. He is also the first ex-employee of ISI being elected to hold the honorable chair of president of ISI since its inception in 1931. [4] [5] 
His areas of  research  interests include  fuzzy sets  and uncertainty analysis,  artificial neural networks  for  machine intelligence ,  pattern recognition ,  image processing ,  data mining , granular computing,  genetic algorithms ,  rough sets , and  soft computing  with applications such as in bioinformatics, video analytics, online social network anlysis, and cognitive mind development. He has pioneered  hybrid intelligent systems  like neuro fuzzy and  rough fuzzy hybridization . The generic families of such hybrid intelligent models (networks) developed not only provide enhanced learning, understandability, knowledge mining and uncertainty management in decision-making, but also can explain the network decision in natural language. Besides, rough-fuzzy hybridization enables mining linguistic, categorical, and relational data. All these have led to significant synergistic technological developments in modern AI and data science. His image processing research in 1970s is perhaps the first investigation (other pioneer being A. Rosenfeld, UMD, College Park, USA) that brings out the root relation between the abstract concept of fuzzy sets and image processing tasks and the associated uncertainty. Subsequently, definitions for image entropy (mid 1980s) and generalized rough-fuzzy entropy (mid 2000s) based on logarithmic and exponential gain functions are provided for modelling uncertainty. These measures are unique. Prof. Pal is widely recognized across the world for his pioneering and extraordinary contributions in Machine Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition. This has made India a leader in these disciplines in international scenario. His other highly cited original/ fundamental research include: i) Unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm (in early 2000s) producing maximally independent features, that results in fast and superior performance and is suitable for  Big data , ii) Granular computing concept and models particularly when samples are indiscernible; here computations are performed using information granules rather than individual samples, thereby providing gain in both computation and performance in mining tasks, and iii) Z*-number, developed in mid 2010s, for machine subjectivity representation in machine-mind development by encapsulating the objective and subjective time, context, and affect components in natural language of thoughts, speech, and texts. 
He is a co-author of twenty one books, about five hundred and fifty research publications, and two US patents. He has served/serving as editor in most of the well-known scientific journals in computer science and engineering (~25 international journals). [1]  He visited more than forty countries as a Keynote/ Invited speaker or academic visitor. He has co-authored with researchers from 48 foreign and 16 Indian institutes.
According to  Google Scholar , Pal's work had been cited about 37,000 times with h-index of 84.
SK Pal is the scientist who introduced the Soft Computing concept and research in India.
For his outstanding contributions, the Department of Science and Technology, GoI, established under his leadership the Center for Soft Computing Research (CSCR), first in Asia, in 2004 at ISI, Kolkata. Subsequently, CSCR is declared by the Governing Body of ISI as an Associate Institute of ISI in 2010.
Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU) founded by him in 1993 at ISI, Kolkata has now turned out to be an internationally recognized leading research school producing many science leaders.
It is during his directorship of ISI (2005-2010), when the birthday of Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was declared by the Prime Minister of India on 24 Dec 2006, as the “National Statistics Day” to be celebrated every year over the country. Further, establishing the ISI-Chennai Center, approving the ISI-North Eastern Center, and replacing UGC-pay scales by higher IISc-pay scales for faculty at ISI, are some other major achievements under his visionary leadership as Director of ISI. All these have long lasting educational and societal impact.
Biennial International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI), started in 2005, is his brainchild. This facilitates regular interaction among Indian researchers with international experts in AI, ML and related areas for advancing science & technology.
He has graduated officially 22 PhD students, so far, in India and abroad. They are all well placed in academia and industry. Many of whom are internationally known leading scientists with recognitions like Fellows of IEEE, TWAS, IFSA, INSA, INAE, J.C. Bose National Fellow, Padma Shri, S.S. Bhatnagar awardee, P.C. Mahalanobis National Award of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI), Govt. of India, Vice-President of Multinational IT Company, and Director of premier national Institutes.
Besides his academic and research contributions, he has instituted for societal benefit -
i) Two Merit-cum-Means Scholarships in 2013 for supporting two economically backward students of Classes IX and X every year in his alma-mater, Ariadaha Kalachand High School, Kolkata 700057, India. This facilitates them to complete their secondary school education. 
ii) A Gold Medal Award at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in 2003 for the best M.Tech.(Computer Science) dissertation to encourages and promotes research excellence.
Patriotism:   NASA Johnson Space Center , Houston, TX, USA, desired to offer him a " Green card " in 1991 requesting to stay permanently in the USA when he was working there as a National Research Council ( US National Academy of Sciences ) Guest Investigator (Resident Research Associate). But he turned down the offer and returned back to India to serve his country for ever.

Surname: Pavón
Awards: 0
Education: Pavón belongs to the first Spanish generation to get official studies in  Computer Science , during the 1980s. [11]  He studied  Computer Science  at the  Technical University of Madrid , graduating in 1985. In 1988, he obtained his PhD in this area with the  thesis : "Synthesis of communication protocols from service specifications". [12]  While doing this thesis, he worked as assistant professor at the same university. After his PhD, he joined  Alcatel-Lucent   R&D  team, where he worked for 10 years. At the end of 1997 he got an  Associate Professor  position at  UCM , and in 2006, he achieved the  Habilitation à diriger des recherches  qualification in Computer Science at the  Université Pierre et Marie Curie  (Paris VI) with the thesis "INGENIAS : Développement Dirigé par Modèles des Systèmes Multi-Agents" (in French). [13] [11] [14] 
He joined the Alcatel R&D department as a systems engineer. There, he worked on the development of software  component-based   architectures  for  distributed systems , and its applications for multimedia services over  broadband networks  and new generation mobile phones. During the 10 years he worked for the company, he spent periods in Alcatel centers outside Spain, such as France ( Lannion  and  Vélizy ) and Belgium ( Namur  and  Antwerp ). [11]  In this period, he worked several years in the labs of  Bellcore  in  Red Bank, New Jersey  (USA), [14]  working in the  TINA-C  Core Team, and helping to produce  architectural models  for telecommunication services. As a result, he published several popular works. [15] [16] 
He then returned to the academic world, as an  Associate Professor  at the Computer Science School of the Complutense University of Madrid (1997). By then, he researched  Multi-Agent Systems  within the  Eurescom  project P815 "Communications Management Process Integration Using Software Agents" (1999) working with  Telefónica  R+D. [17]  His work in several projects combines  software engineering  practices and MAS. In the Eurescom P907 "Methodology for Engineering Systems of Software Agents", he co-created the MESSAGE  methodology , currently part of the main  FIPA [18]  software agent methodologies. [19] [11] 
In 2000 he established the research group GRASIA [2]  for the research in  Software Agents  and  Artificial Intelligence  in the  Complutense University of Madrid . [2]  He also held several management positions in the university, serving as Vice Dean for four years (1998–2002). [20]  Nowadays, he is  full professor  at the  Universidad Complutense Madrid .
Pavón work has focused on  Software Agents  and  Agent-based simulation . [21]  His work on  Software Agents  started at the end of the 1990s, after they emerge as a new paradigm. [22]  His first project in the area was funded by  Telefonica  R+D, "Communications Management Process Integration Using Software Agents" (1999). Later he attracted funding for research projects from the 5th  European Framework Programme  (PSI3, DEMOS) and from Euroscom (P815, P907), all considered early applications of agents to software engineering processes. [23]  In the Eurescom P907 "Methodology for Engineering Systems of Software Agents", he co-created the MESSAGE  methodology , currently part of the main  FIPA [18]  software agent methodologies. [19] [11] 
His main contribution combining agent concepts in software engineering is the  INGENIAS  methodology and toolkit. INGENIAS (Engineering for Software Agents) is a complete  framework  for the analysis, design and implementation of  multi-agent systems  (MAS). [24] [25] 
As a result of the research in these years, Jorge J. Gómez-Sanz published in 2002 his PhD thesis "A Methodology for the Development of Multi-Agent Systems" (in Spanish) advised by Francisco Garijo and Juan Pavón. This work constitutes the first version of the INGENIAS methodology and its meta-models. [26] 
INGENIAS adopts since its inception a  model-driven engineering  (MDE) approach. [26]   Model-driven engineering  (MDE) organizes developments around the specification of systems through models that are automatically transformed to generate other artefacts, e.g., code, tests, or documentation. [27]  INGENIAS follows these principles specifying the MAS meta-models that define its  modeling language  and allow  generating automatically  its development tools distributed as the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK). [28]  This approach supports research in different areas characterized by the use of modeling languages and requiring flexibility to adapt these to new requirements. Thus, it has been also used in  Agent-based simulation . [29] [30]  INGENIAS development process has been one of the few processes of agent-oriented  methodologies  in having their development process formally specified with  SPEM , a language of the Object Management Group ( OMG ). Currently, there is one development process based on the  Unified Process  and another based on  Scrum . [31] 
The INGENIAS modeling language and the open-source tools for its application made it a popular methodology in the agent literature. It has been included in relevant surveys and comparisons in the field. [32] [33]  The open-source INGENIAS associated tools are also successful in the agent community, as assessed by their number of downloads. [34] 
The level of maturity reached by the INGENIAS framework and related tools, mainly INGENME, in its application to Software Agents, allowed the GRASIA group to consider its application to other domains.  Agent-based simulation  has been one with an immediate application. As in  Software Agents , agent-based simulation (ABS) relies on the concept of agent, in this case as the basic block to build computational simulations. The conceptual similarities between the concept of agent in both disciplines, and the suitability of models to work with simulations, made of agent-based simulation a sensible extension for INGENIAS work. [29] [30] 
This line of research started in GRASIA with a direct application of the works in INGENIAS with software agents to ABS for the PhD thesis of Candelaria Sansores "A Methodology for the Study of Artificial Societies" (2007), advised by Pavonl. [35]  This work pointed out the suitability of applying the MDE approach of INGENIAS to this field, but also the problems of researchers without a background on  Software Engineering  to use INGENIAS. These first attempts were oriented to simulations intended to verify behavioral principles described by well-known laws, but not to explore simulations based on the use of big amounts of raw data. This  data-driven   agent-based social simulation  was the subject of the interdisciplinary PhD thesis of  Samer Hassan  "Towards a Data Driven Approach for Agent Based Modelling: Simulating Spanish Postmodernization", also advised by Juan Pavón. [36] 
The use of INGENIAS for ABS is based on the adoption of MDE to build simulations. [29]  This approach was developed and validated by GRASIA in different domains, e.g., urbanism and group work. [36] [37] 
He has achieved multiple agreements with relevant research groups: ICAR-CNR, SenSysCal.it, INSISOC, SMAC. [38] [39] [40] [41]  and industry such as  Telefonica  R+D or  Boeing  Research and Technology Europe. His topics of interest cover several disciplines, including simulation of  complex systems , agent-oriented software engineering,  artificial intelligent applications , [42]   Responsible Research and Innovation , [43] [44] [45]   Ethics in AI , [6] [46]   Smart Cities , [47] [48]   Blockchain , [49]   Legal Tech [50] [51]  and inclusion tech. [52] [53] [54] 
Pavón joined the European research networks on  Software Agents  and  Agent-based simulation , AgentLink [55]  and AgentCities, [56]  and has contributed to different international projects funded by the  European Commission : VITAL, [57]  MOMOCS, [58]  PSI3, DEMOS, AGENTCITIES.NET, P2Pvalue. [3] 
He has worked on more than 30 research projects, leading 20 of them, [11]  with public and private funding. He accounts more than 260 scientific publications, and an H-index of 34. [59]  He is a research consultant for dozens of committees and part of the editorial board of several journals in the field of computer science. He is member of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence., [60]  the European Social Simulation Association, the  FIPA  board, the  European Association for the Study of Science and Technology , the  IEEE Computer Society , and scientific project evaluator of the  European Commission . [61] [14] 
In 2006 he received an honorary PhD from the  Université Pierre et Marie Curie  (París 6). [62] 
His research group GRASIA has achieved some recognition through several awards:
Pavón is author of several books and more than 260 scientific articles on  Software Agents ,  Artificial Intelligence  and  Software Engineering . [59]  A selection of highly cited works are:

Surname: Pearl
Awards: 4
Education: Judea Pearl was born in Tel Aviv , British Mandate for Palestine , in 1936 to Polish Jewish immigrant parents. [8] He is a descendant of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk on his mother's side. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz , Pearl decided to study engineering in 1956. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the Technion 1960. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and pursued graduate studies. He received an M.S. in electrical engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now the New Jersey Institute of Technology ) in 1961, and went on to receive an M.S. in physics from Rutgers University and a PhD in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering ) in 1965. [9] He worked at RCA Research Laboratories (now SRI International ) in Princeton, New Jersey on superconductive parametric amplifiers and storage devices and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. [9] When semiconductors "wiped out" Pearl's work, as he later expressed it, [10] he joined UCLA 's School of Engineering in 1970 and started work on probabilistic artificial intelligence . He is one of the founding editors of the Journal of Causal Inference .

Surname: Perlman
Awards: 11
Education: As an undergraduate at  MIT  Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the  LOGO  Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming  system software  such as  debuggers .  [14] 
Working under the supervision of  Seymour Papert , she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS ("Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System"). During research performed in 1974–76, young children—the youngest aged 3½ years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming. [15]  Afterwards, she was inspired to make a new programming language that would teach much younger children similar to Logo, but using special "keyboards" and input devices. This project was abandoned because "being the only woman around, I wanted to be taken seriously as a 'scientist' and was a little embarrassed that my project involved cute little kids". MIT media project later tracked her down and told her that she started a new field called  tangible user interface  from the leftovers of her abandoned project.  [16]  As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at  BBN Technologies . There she first got involved with designing  network protocols . [17]  Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in  Computer Science  from  MIT  in 1988. [18]   Her doctoral thesis on routing in environments where malicious network failures are present serves as the basis for much of the work that now exists in this area.  [2] 
When studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women’s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men’s dorms at MIT became  coed  Perlman moved out of the women’s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the "resident female". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that "it kind of looked weird". [19]

Surname: Rabin
Awards: 10
Education: Rabin was born in 1931 in  Breslau ,  Germany  (today  Wrocław , in  Poland ), the son of a  rabbi . In 1935, he  emigrated  with his family to  Mandate Palestine . As a young boy, he was very interested in mathematics and his father sent him to the best high school in  Haifa , where he studied under mathematician  Elisha Netanyahu , who was then a high school teacher. [1] 
Rabin graduated from the  Hebrew Reali School  in Haifa in 1948, and was drafted into the army during the  1948 Arab–Israeli War . The mathematician  Abraham Fraenkel , who was a professor of mathematics in  Jerusalem , intervened with the army command, and Rabin was discharged to study at the university in 1949. [1]  Afterwards, he received an M.Sc from  Hebrew University of Jerusalem . He began graduate studies at the  University of Pennsylvania  before receiving a  Ph.D.  from  Princeton University  in 1956. [2] 
Rabin became Associate Professor of Mathematics at the  University of California, Berkeley  (1961–62) and  MIT  (1962-63). Before moving to  Harvard University  as Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science in 1981, he was a professor at the Hebrew University. [3] 
In the late 1950s, he was invited for a summer to do research for  IBM  at the Lamb Estate in  Westchester County, New York  with other promising mathematicians and scientists. It was there that he and  Dana Scott  wrote the paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems". [4]  Soon, using nondeterministic automata, they were able to re-prove  Kleene's  result that finite state machines exactly accept regular languages. [1] 
As to the origins of what was to become  computational complexity theory , the next summer Rabin returned to the Lamb Estate.  John McCarthy  posed a puzzle to him about spies, guards, and passwords, which Rabin studied and soon after he wrote an article, "Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets." [1] [5] 
Nondeterministic machines  have become a key concept in computational complexity theory, particularly with the description of the  complexity classes P and NP .
Rabin then returned to Jerusalem, researching logic, and working on the foundations of what would later be known as  computer science . He was an associate professor and the head of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University at 29 years old, and a full professor by 33. Rabin recalls, "There was absolutely no appreciation of the work on the issues of computing. Mathematicians did not recognize the emerging new field". [1] 
In 1960, he was invited by  Edward F. Moore  to work at  Bell Labs , where Rabin introduced  probabilistic automata  that employ coin tosses in order to decide which state transitions to take. He showed examples of regular languages that required a very large number of states, but for which you get an exponential reduction of the number of states with probabilistic automata. [1] 
In 1969, Rabin introduced   infinite-tree automata  and proved that the   monadic second-order theory  of  n  successors ( S2S  when  n  = 2) is  decidable . [6]  A key component of the proof implicitly showed  determinacy  of  parity games , which lie in the third level of the  Borel hierarchy .
In 1975, Rabin finished his tenure as Rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and went to the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in the USA as a visiting professor. While there, Rabin invented the  Miller–Rabin primality test , a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (but with a tiny probability of error) whether a number is  prime . [7] [8]  Rabin's method was based on previous work of  Gary Miller  that solved the problem deterministically with the assumption that the  generalized Riemann hypothesis  is true, but Rabin's version of the test made no such assumption. Fast primality testing is key in the successful implementation of most public-key cryptography, and in 2003 Miller, Rabin,  Robert M. Solovay , and  Volker Strassen  were given the  Paris Kanellakis Award  for their work on primality testing.
In 1976 he was invited by  Joseph Traub  to meet at  Carnegie Mellon University  and presented the primality test. After he gave that lecture, Traub had said, "No, no, this is revolutionary, and it's going to become very important." [1] 
In 1979, Rabin invented the  Rabin cryptosystem , the first asymmetric cryptosystem whose security was proved equivalent to the intractability of  integer factorization . [9] 
In 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak variant of the technique of  oblivious transfer  invented by Wiesner under the name of multiplexing, [10]  allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning the message, with the sender being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so.
In 1987, Rabin, together with  Richard Karp , created one of the most well-known efficient  string search algorithms , the  Rabin–Karp string search algorithm , known for its  rolling hash . [11] 
Rabin's more recent research has concentrated on computer security. He is currently the  Thomas J. Watson Sr.  Professor of Computer Science at  Harvard University  and Professor of Computer Science at  Hebrew University . During the spring semester of 2007, he was a visiting professor at  Columbia University  teaching  Introduction to  Cryptography .

[7]  He has a brother,  Just van Rossum , who is a  type designer  and programmer who designed the  typeface  used in the "Python Powered" logo. [8] 
Van Rossum lives in  Belmont , California, with his wife, Kim Knapp, [9]  and their son. [10] [11] [12]  According to his home page and  Dutch naming conventions , the " van " in his name is capitalized when he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using his first and last name together. [13] 
While working at the  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica  (CWI), Van Rossum wrote and contributed a  glob()  routine to  BSD   Unix  in 1986 [14] [15]  and helped develop the  ABC programming language . He once stated, "I try to mention ABC's influence because I'm indebted to everything I learned during that project and to the people who worked on it." [16]  He also created  Grail , an early  web browser  written in Python, and engaged in discussions about the  HTML  standard. [17] 
He has worked for various research institutes, including the  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica  (CWI) in the Netherlands, the U.S.  National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), and the  Corporation for National Research Initiatives  (CNRI). In May 2000, he left CNRI along with three other Python core developers to work for tech startup BeOpen.com, which subsequently collapsed by October of the same year. [18] [19]  From late 2000 until 2003 he worked for  Zope  Corporation. In 2003 Van Rossum left Zope for Elemental Security. While there he worked on a custom programming language for the organization. [20] 
From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at  Google , where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. 
At Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a web-based  code review  system written in Python and used within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter  Piet Mondrian . [21]  He named another related  software project  after  Gerrit Rietveld , a Dutch designer. [22]  On 7 December 2012, Van Rossum left Google. [23] 
In January 2013, Van Rossum started working at the  cloud file storage  company  Dropbox . [24] [25] 
In October 2019, Van Rossum left Dropbox and officially retired. [26] [27] [28] 
On 12 November 2020 Van Rossum announced that he was coming out of retirement to join the Developer Division at  Microsoft . He currently holds the title Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. [29] [30] [31] 
In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a  " 'hobby' programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an  interpreter  for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of  ABC  that would appeal to  Unix / C  hackers". He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of  Monty Python's Flying Circus )". [32] 
He has explained that Python's predecessor,  ABC , was inspired by  SETL , noting that ABC co-developer  Lambert Meertens  had "spent a year with the SETL group at  NYU  before coming up with the final ABC design". [33] 
On 12 July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of  BDFL  of the Python programming language. [34] 
In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to  DARPA  called "Computer Programming for Everybody", in which he further defined his goals for Python:
In 2019, Python became the second most popular language on  GitHub , the largest  source code  management website on the internet, second only to  JavaScript . [35]  According to a programming language popularity survey [36]  it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the  TIOBE Programming Community Index  and got the number one spot on the index in October 2021.

Surname: Salton
Awards: 6
Education: Salton was born Gerhard Anton Sahlmann on in  Nuremberg, Germany . He came to the United States in 1947 and was naturalized in 1952. He received a Bachelor's (1950) and Master's (1952) degree in mathematics from  Brooklyn College , and a Ph.D. from  Harvard  in  applied mathematics  in 1958, the last of  Howard Aiken 's doctoral students, and taught there until 1965, when he joined  Cornell University  and co-founded its department of Computer Science.
Salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used  vector space model  for Information Retrieval. [2]   In this model, both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts, and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector.  In this paper, he also introduced  TF-IDF , or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by  Karen Sparck-Jones . [3] ) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis, [4]  as well as automatic hypertext generation. [5]   He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life.

Surname: Simon
Awards: 10
Education: Herbert Alexander Simon was born in  Milwaukee ,  Wisconsin  on June 15, 1916. Simon's father, Arthur Simon (1881–1948), was a  Jewish [13]  electrical engineer who came to the United States from  Germany  in 1903 after earning his engineering degree at  Technische Hochschule Darmstadt . [14]  An inventor, Arthur also was an independent patent attorney. [15]  Simon's mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel (1888–1969), was an accomplished pianist whose Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic ancestors came from  Braunschweig ,  Prague  and  Cologne . [16]  Simon's European ancestors were piano makers,  goldsmiths , and  vintners .
Simon attended  Milwaukee Public Schools , where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist. While attending middle school, Simon wrote a letter to "the editor of the  Milwaukee Journal  defending the civil liberties of atheists". [17]  Unlike most children, Simon's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically; his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel (1892–1922), who studied economics at the  University of Wisconsin–Madison  under  John R. Commons , became one of his earliest influences. Through Harold's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered social science. Among his earliest influences, Simon cited  Norman Angell  for his book  The Great Illusion  and  Henry George  for his book  Progress and Poverty . While attending high school, Simon joined the debate team, where he argued "from conviction, rather than cussedness" in favor of George's  single tax . [18] 
In 1933, Simon entered the  University of Chicago , and, following his early influences, decided to study social science and mathematics. Simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his "color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory". [19]  At an early age, Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world. While in college, Simon focused on  political science  and  economics . Simon's most important mentor was  Henry Schultz , an  econometrician  and  mathematical economist . [1]  Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science from the University of Chicago, where he studied under  Harold Lasswell ,  Nicolas Rashevsky ,  Rudolf Carnap , Henry Schultz, and  Charles Edward Merriam . [20]  After enrolling in a course on "Measuring Municipal Governments," Simon became a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, and the two co-authored  Measuring Municipal Activities: A Survey of Suggested Criteria for Appraising Administration  in 1938. [21]  Simon's studies led him to the field of  organizational   decision-making , which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation.

[2]  He went to school in  Cape Town  between 1948 and 1953, then earned a degree in Mathematics and Physics at the  University of Cape Town  in 1956, after which a  Rhodes Scholarship  (from South African College School) took him to the  University of Oxford  (first  Balliol College , and then  St Antony's College ). In Oxford, he became interested in philosophy after a brief period studying  mathematical logic  supervised by  Hao Wang , eventually writing a DPhil in philosophy, defending the ideas of  Immanuel Kant  about the nature of mathematical knowledge as non- empirical  and  non-analytic  ('Knowing and Understanding', 1962, now online at  AARON SLOMAN DPHIL 1962 ).

Srihari is the founding director of  Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition  (CEDAR) which was established with support from the  United States Postal Service .  Work at CEDAR led to the first handwritten address interpretation system in the world, [2] [3]  versions of which were deployed by the  Internal Revenue Service , USPS,  Australia Post  and UK Royal Mail. His subsequent work led to the first handwriting verification and identification system known as  CEDAR-FOX , which was granted a U.S. Patent in 2009.
Srihari had a leading role in establishing the international conferences on document analysis and recognition, frontiers of  handwriting recognition  and  computational forensics . [1] [4]  He also served on the Board of Scientific Counselors of the  National Library of Medicine  for six years.
In 2002, Srihari published a landmark study establishing the individuality of handwriting. [5] [6]   This work was cited in  Daubert standard  and  Frye standard  hearings in United States courts leading to the admission of  handwriting evidence  in those cases. This research work was later extended to shoe-print and fingerprint recognition as well. [7] [8]   Srihari served on the  National Academy of Sciences  Committee on Identifying the needs of the Forensic Science Community which led to a highly influential report entitled "Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward" published in April 2009.

Surname: Stachowiak
Awards: 0
Education: After graduating from  East High School (Rochester, New York)  in 1994, [1]  Stachowiak was accepted into  MIT  where he completed  Course 6 - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  and received both his  S.B.  and  M.Eng.  in 1998. [2] 
While at MIT Stachowiak worked on the Rethinking CS101 project, [3] [4]  and in 1997 he began the  Scheme Constraints Window Manager  project with  Greg J. Badros . [5]   He also contributed to a paper with the Cognitive & Neural Sciences  Office of Naval Research . [6]   Stachowiak's MIT M.Eng. thesis on "Automated Extraction of Structured data from HTML Documents" was indicative of his early interest in web standards and development. [7] 
From 1999 to 2001,  Stachowiak contributed to various  Linux  software projects and was employed by  Eazel  as one of their lead developers along with  Andy Hertzfeld  and  Darin Adler  to create the  Nautilus file manager .  He was also a developer on the Object Activation Framework (OAF) for the  GNOME   desktop environment  from 1999 to 2001.  In 1999, he became a maintainer for the  Scheme  interpreter for  Guile . [8]   During his employment at Eazel, Stachowiak also contributed to  Eye of GNOME , GNOME Libs, Gravevine, GnoP, and was a Developer on Medusa,  Bonobo , and  GNOME VFS .  Stachowiak was also a member of  GNOME Foundation  board of directors. [9]   He told  Fortune  magazine , "[Eazel's] seemed like a borderline-crazy business plan ... But I said, 'Sure, I'll work on it.'" while his colleagues "fidgeted uncomfortably". [10]   Two months later, Eazel ceased operations, laying off its entire staff. [11] 
After the closure of Eazel, most of the remaining senior engineers (including  Bud Tribble , Don Melton,  Darin Adler , John Sullivan, Ken Kocienda, and Stachowiak) joined Apple's Safari team in June 2001 and were later joined by  Netscape / Mozilla Firefox  alumnus  David Hyatt . [1] [12]   On June 13, 2002, Stachowiak announced on a mailing list that Apple was releasing JavaScriptCore, a framework for Mac OS X that was based on  KDE's JavaScript engine . [13]   Through the WebKit project, JavaScriptCore has since evolved into  SquirrelFish Extreme , a JavaScript engine that compiles JavaScript into native machine code.  On June 6, 2005, Webkit was made open source (which was coincidentally Stachowiak's birthday).
Stachowiak wrote on behalf of Apple along with members of the  Mozilla Foundation  and  Opera Software  in a proposal that the new HTML working group of the W3C adopt the   Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group ’s  HTML5  as the starting point of its work. [14]  On 9 May 2007, the new HTML working group resolved to do that.  In May 2009, Stachowiak co-authored the W3C HTML Design Principles for HTML5, one of his first major documentation projects for the W3C. [15]  As of 27 August 2009, Stachowiak has co-chaired the  World Wide Web Consortium 's HTML Working Group along with  IBM 's  Sam Ruby  and  Microsoft 's  Paul Cotton . [16] [17] 
WebKit, the underpinnings of Safari, was published as  open-source software  on June 6, 2005. When Safari was run with this latest version of WebKit, it passed the  Web Standards Project 's  Acid2  test.  Stachowiak reported on the WebKit blog on March 26, 2008, that the software had passed 100/100 on the  Acid3  test, making Safari the first browser to pass. [18] [19]

Surname: Starner
Awards: 0
Education: Starner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  with a  B.S.  in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in  Computer Science  (1991), a  M.S.  in Media Arts and Science, and finally a  Ph.D.  in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the  MIT Media Laboratory . His doctoral work was entitled "Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness," dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in  American Sign Language . [3] [4] [5] 
Starner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for  wearable computing . During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy on-line cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 [1] [5]  as an associate scientist with  BBN 's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the  IEEE  International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6  cyborgs  involved. [1]  Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instance. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed "The Lizzy", based on designs of the wearable "hip PC" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a  Twiddler   chorded keyboard . [6] [7] [8]  As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an  OQO  Model 1  Ultra-Mobile PC  (though the specifications listed suggest an  OQO Model 01+ ) with a  GHz  processor, 512 MB of  RAM , 30GB hard disk,  USB2 ,  Firewire , and  Wi-Fi  built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well. [9] 
Some of the benefits he receives from wearing a  computer  include being able to type and access the  Internet  while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a  conversation  in  real-time , opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out. [9]  In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a  speech impediment  but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a computer. [10] 
Starner is a Technical Lead/Manager on  Google 's  Project Glass  wearable computing project. [11] 
One of his prominent research focuses is the involvement of wearable computing with  American Sign Language  (ASL). His work intends to create a bridge between the deaf and hearing communities that will facilitate communication between the two using an ASL-to-English one-way  translator . Starner is also researching dual-purpose speech, where a wearable computer will be able to interpret certain speech patterns and bring up appropriate programs, such as a calendar for scheduling appointments. [5] [9] [12]  In addition, Starner has been involved in the Aware Home project, which uses technology to create an interactive and personalizable environment within the home that would benefit individuals who wouldn't normally be able to live independently. [13] 
Starner's preeminence in his field earned him a spot among  Technology Review 's  TR100  top 100 remarkable innovators (now renamed TR35 and limited to thirty-five winners) in 1999. [2]  His work has featured on  CBS 's 60 Minutes,  CNN ,  BBC , and  The Wall Street Journal  and has been demonstrated to a number of  Fortune 500  companies including  Merrill Lynch ,  IBM , and  Motorola .

Surname: Torres
Awards: 1
Education: In the last years of his life, Torres turned his attention to the field of  educational disciplines , to investigate those elements or machines that could help educators in their task. From 1922 to 1930 he patented improvements on  typewriters , [124]  marginal  pagination  of manuals, [125]  and, especially, the "Puntero Proyectable" ("Projectable Pointer"), [126]  and the "Proyector Didáctico" ("Didactic Projector"). [127]  The Projectable Pointer was based on the shadow produced by an opaque body that moves close to the projected plate, being this shadow used as a pointer. To do this, he designed an articulated system that allowed the speaker to move a point or points next to the projection plate, at will, which made it possible to mark the areas of interest on the transparency. [128]  The Didactic Projector improved the way slides were placed on glass plates for projection. [129] 
In 1910 Torres traveled to  Argentina [130]  with the Infanta  Isabel  to assist at the International Scientific Congress held in  Buenos Aires , one of the events organized to mark the centenary of the  independence  of Argentina. He presented the project entitled "Unión Internacional Hispano–Americana de Bibliografía y Tecnología Científica", to clarify, enhance, unify, and enrich the Spanish technical language. The first task was the publication of a technological dictionary of the Spanish language in order to tackle the problems caused by the increasing use of scientific and technological neologisms, as well as the adaptation of words from other languages, confronted with the avalanche of foreign terms. [131]  In 1930 appeared the Volume 1 of the  Diccionario Tecnológico Hispanoamericano . [132] [133] 
In the early 1900s, Torres learned the international language  Esperanto , and was an advocate of the language throughout his life. From 1922 to 1926, he participated in the work of the  International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation  of the  League of Nations , [134]  proposing the following motion on the first day of the meeting: "The Committee, convinced of the usefulness of an artificial auxiliary language to facilitate scientific relations between different peoples, establishes a subcommittee in charge of studying , with the help of experts, the various solutions that have been proposed". Although almost half of the Committee members were in favor of Esperanto, the motion met with determined opposition from some other participants. In 1925 Torres participated as the official representative of the  Spanish government  in the "Conference on the Use of Esperanto in Pure and Applied Sciences" held in  Paris , together with  Vicente Inglada Ors  [ es ]  and  Emilio Herrera Linares . That same year, he joined to the Honorary Committee of the  Spanish Association of Esperanto  [ es ]  (HEA), founded by  Julio Mangada . [135] [136] 
From the work he carried out in these years, Torres entered the  Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences  of Madrid in 1901, of which entity he was president between 1928 and 1934. In 1910 he became a corresponding member of the  Argentine Scientific Society  [ es ] . In 1916 King  Alfonso XIII of Spain  bestowed the  Echegaray Medal  upon him; [137]  and in 1918, he declined the offer of the position of  Minister of Development . In 1920, he was admitted to the  Royal Spanish Academy , to fill the seat vacated by the death of  Benito Pérez Galdós , declaring modestly in his speech: "You were wrong in choosing me as I do not have that minimum culture required of an academic. I will always be a stranger in your wise and learned society. I come from very remote lands. I have not cultivated literature, nor art, nor philosophy, nor even science, at least in its higher degrees… My work is much more modest. I spend my busy life solving practical mechanics problems. My laboratory is a locksmith shop, more complete, better assembled than those usually known by that name; but destined, like all, to project and build mechanisms…"  [138] [139] 
That same year he was elected president of the  Royal Spanish Mathematical Society , a position he held until 1924 and became a member of the Department of Mechanics of the Paris Academy. From 1921 to 1929 he assumed the presidency of the Spanish section of the  International Committee for Weights and Measures . In 1923 the  Sorbonne  named him an Honorary Doctor [140]  and became an honorary member of the  Geneva Society of Physics and Natural History  [ fr ] . In 1925 was appointed a corresponding member of the  Hispanic Society of America . In 1927 he was named one of the twelve foreign associate members of the  French Academy of Sciences . Between 1906 and 1934 he also received other decorations: [141] [142] 
In 1885 Torres married  Luz Polanco y Navarro  in Portolín ( Molledo ), with whom he had eight children: Leonardo (died at age 2), Gonzalo (later his collaborator), Luz, Valentina, Luisa, Julia, Leonardo and Fernando. After the death of his first son, in 1889, he moved to  Madrid  with the firm intention of putting into practice the projects he had devised in previous years. During this time he attended the  Athenæum , the literary gatherings at the  Café Suizo  [ es ]  and the Elipa, but generally without participating in debates and discussions of a political nature. He lived for many years in  Calle de Válgame Dios  [ es ]  nº 3. [143] [144] 
On 18 December 1936, after a progressive illness, Torres died at the home of his son Gonzalo in Madrid, in the heat of the  Spanish Civil War , ten days before his eighty-fourth birthday. [145] [146]  He was buried in the monumental  Saint Isidore Cemetery . [147] 
The wise Spanish engineer Torres Quevedo - today a foreign associate of our  Academy of Sciences  - who is perhaps the most prodigious inventor of our time, at least in terms of mechanisms, has not afraid to tackle Babbage's problem in turn.
What prospects do such marvels open on the possibilities of the future as regards the reduction to a purely mechanical process of any operation obeying mathematical rules!" In this field, the way was opened, nearly three centuries ago, by the genius of Pascal; in recent times, the genius of Torres Quevedo has succeeded in making it penetrate into regions where one would never have dared to think a priori that it could have access.
After Torres died in 1936, the distressing circumstances that Spain was going during its Civil War meant that his death would go somewhat unnoticed. However, such newspapers as  The New York Times  or the French mathematician  Maurice d'Ocagne  published  obituaries  in 1937 and 1938 praising his engineering and research work, the latter giving some conferences in Paris and  Brussels . [149] [150] [151] [152] 
Created the  Spanish National Research Council  (CSIC) in 1939, the architect  Ricardo Fernández Vallespín  [ es ]  was commissioned with the project and construction of a large building in Madrid to house the new Institute «Leonardo Torres Quevedo» of Applied Physics, which was completed in 1943. [153] [154]  Its dedicated to "designing and manufacturing instruments and investigating mechanical, electrical and electronic problems", and was the germ of the current  Institute of Physical and Information Technologies "Leonardo Torres Quevedo" (ITEFI) . [155] 
In the years following his death, Torres was not forgotten. In 1953 began the commemorative acts of the Centenary of his birth, [156]  taking place at the  Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences  with the intervention of high-ranking academic, scientific and university personalities from the country and abroad, such as  Louis Couffignal ,  Charles Lambert Manneback , and  Aldo Ghizzetti  [ it ] . [157] [158] 
In 1955 and 1983, two  postage stamps  were issued in Spain in his honor, the last one next to the image of the  Niagara  cable car. [159] 
The  Leonardo Torres Quevedo Foundation  [ es ]  (FLTQ) was created in 1981 under his name as a non-profit organization to promote scientific research within the framework of the  University of Cantabria  and to training professionals in this area. The Foundation had its headquarters at the  University of Cantabria School of Civil Engineering . [160] 
In 1983, the  Leonardo Torres Quevedo National Research Award  [ es ]  was established in Spain by the  Ministry of Science  to recognize the merits of Spanish scientists or researchers in the field of engineering. [161] 
A  bronze statue  on a stone pedestal was erected in 1986 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his death. The work was commissioned to the sculptor  Ramón Muriedas  [ es ]  and its located in  Santa Cruz de Iguña , Torres' birth town. [162] 
In 2007, the prestigious  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) dedicated a Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing [163]  to the  Telekino , based on the research work developed at Technical University of Madrid by Prof.  Antonio Pérez Yuste , who was the driving force behind the Milestone nomination.
On 19 July 2008,  Spain's National Lottery  [ es ]  commemorated the centenary of the Torres Quevedo airship built in Guadalajara, which was the beginnings of the  Spanish Military Aerostation  [ es ] . [164]  The same year, the  Leonardo Torres Quevedo Center  was opened in  Santa Cruz de Iguña , dedicated to his life and work. [165] 
On 28 December 2012,  Google  celebrated his 160th birthday with a  Google Doodle . [166]  That same year the company had also commemorated the 100th anniversary of " El Ajedrecista ", highlighting that it was a marvel of its time and could be considered the "grandfather" of current video games. A conference was organized on November 7 in cooperation with the School of Telecommunication Engineering of the  Technical University of Madrid  to exhibit the devices devised by the Spanish engineer. [167] 
On 8 August 2016, the 100th Anniversary of the  Whirlpool Aero Car  was celebrated for its uninterrupted operation, without having had any accidents. The ceremony also included members of the Torres Quevedo family, who made a special trip from Spain to attend the anniversary celebrations and  Carlos Gómez-Múgica  [ es ]  , the Spanish Ambassador to  Canada . According to  Niagara Parks Commission  Chair,  Janice Thomson , "this morning’s celebrations have allowed us to properly mark an important milestone in the history of the Niagara Parks Commission, all while recognizing the accomplishments and paying tribute to Leonardo Torres Quevedo, who through his work made a lasting impression on both the engineering profession and the tourism industry here in Niagara." [168] 
In 2022 was presented in  Santander  the new  turbosail  of  La Fura dels Baus ,  La Naumon , a large white structure at the base of which stands out the figure of Leonardo Torres Quevedo, with whose name it was baptized the device. [169]  On 4 July, the flag carrier  Iberia  received the fifth of the six  Airbus A320neo  planned for that year. This A320neo with registration EC-NTQ bears the name "Leonardo Torres Quevedo", to honored the Spanish inventor. [170] 
On 5 May 2023, the  Instituto Cervantes  opened the  Caja de las Letras  to house the "in memoriam" legacy of Leonardo Torres Quevedo. Among the deposited objects, letters and manuscripts; a dozen publications, with books, monographs or catalogues; postcards and a schedule of the Niagara Falls cable car designed by him, and the "Milestone" awarded by the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  that recognizes the engineer's scoop in the development of remote control, for his work carried out in 1901 with the creation of the  Telekino . Torres' granddaughter  Mercedes Torres Quevedo  expressed her gratitude to the institution on behalf of all her descendants for welcoming her grandfather's legacy and the "pride" of all of them for the scientific and humanistic work he carried out throughout of his life. Torres' legacy has been deposited in box number 1275 and the keys in the hands of his descendants and the institution itself. [171] [172] [173]

Surname: Tukey
Awards: 7
Education: Tukey was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1915, to a Latin teacher father and a private tutor. He was mainly taught by his mother and attended regular classes only for certain subjects like French. [3] Tukey obtained a BA in 1936 and MSc in 1937 in chemistry, from Brown University , before moving to Princeton University , where in 1939 he received a PhD in mathematics after completing a doctoral dissertation titled "On denumerability in topology ". [4] [5] [6]

Surname: Turing
Awards: 5
Education: Turing was born in  Maida Vale , London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing was on leave from his position with the  Indian Civil Service  (ICS) of the  British Raj government  at  Chatrapur , then in the  Madras Presidency  and presently in  Odisha  state, in  India . [15] [16]  Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a  baronet . Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing ( née  Stoney ), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the  Madras Railways . The Stoneys were a  Protestant   Anglo-Irish   gentry  family from both  County Tipperary  and  County Longford , while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in  County Clare . [17]  Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at Bartholomew's church on Clyde Road, in Dublin. [18] 
Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the  Bengal Army . However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to  Maida Vale , [19]  London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a  blue plaque  on the outside of the house of his birth, [20] [21]  later the  Colonnade Hotel . [15] [22]  Turing had an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of  Sir John Dermot Turing , 12th Baronet of the  Turing baronets . [23] 
Turing's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents travelled between  Hastings  in the United Kingdom [24]  and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired  Army  couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at  Baston Lodge , Upper Maze Hill,  St Leonards-on-Sea , now marked with a blue plaque. [25]  The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth. [26] 
Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. [27]  His parents purchased a house in  Guildford  in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. [28] 
Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary school at 20 Charles Road,  St Leonards-on-Sea , from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius". [29] 
Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of  Frant  in Sussex (now  East Sussex ). [30]  In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to  Sherborne School , [31]  an independent boarding school in the market town of  Sherborne  in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the  1926 General Strike , in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from  Southampton  to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn. [32] 
Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose  definition of education  placed more emphasis on the  classics . His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming  educated . If he is to be solely a  Scientific Specialist , he is wasting his time at a public school". [33]  Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary  calculus . In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered  Albert Einstein 's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of  Newton's laws of motion  from a text in which this was never made explicit. [34] 
At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), [35]  who has been described as Turing's first love. [36] [37] [38]  Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of  bovine tuberculosis , contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously. [39] [40] [41] 

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote:I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do. [42]
Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday. [43]  A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan. [44]
Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's  atheism  and  materialism . [45]  Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately. [46] [47]After graduating from Sherborne, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B (that is, a three-year Parts I and II, of the  Mathematical Tripos , with extra courses at the end of the third year, as Part III only emerged as a separate degree in 1934) from February 1931 to November 1934 at  King's College, Cambridge , where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. His dissertation,  On the Gaussian error function , written during his senior year and delivered in November 1934 (with a deadline date of 6 December) proved a version of the  central limit theorem . It was finally accepted on 16 March 1935. By spring of that same year, Turing started his master's course (Part III)—which he completed in 1937—and, at the same time, he published his first paper, a one-page article called  Equivalence of left and right almost periodicity  (sent on 23 April), featured in the tenth volume of the  Journal of the London Mathematical Society . [48]  Later that year, Turing was elected a  Fellow  of King's College on the strength of his dissertation. [49]  However, and, unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem he proved in his paper, had already been proven, in 1922, by  Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg . Despite this, the committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship.  Abram Besicovitch 's report for the committee went so far as to say that if Turing's work had been published before Lindeberg's, it would have been "an important event in the mathematical literature of that year". [50] [51] [52] 
Between the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as Church, Turing worked on the decidability of problems, starting from Godel's incompleteness theorems. In mid-April 1936, Turing sent Max Newman the first draft typescript of his investigations. That same month, Alonzo Church published his  An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory , with similar conclusions to Turing's then-yet unpublished work. Finally, on 28 May of that year, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called " On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem ". [53]  It was published in the  Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society  journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December. [54]  In this paper, Turing reformulated  Kurt Gödel 's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as  Turing machines . The  Entscheidungsproblem  (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician  David Hilbert  in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an  algorithm . He went on to prove that there was no solution to the  decision problem  by first showing that the  halting problem  for Turing machines is  undecidable : it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history". [55] 
Although  Turing's proof  was published shortly after  Alonzo Church 's equivalent proof using his  lambda calculus , [56]  Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's. [57]  It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a  universal Turing machine ), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the  Church–Turing thesis , Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable.  John von Neumann  acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper. [58]  To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in  theory of computation . [59] 
From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at  Princeton University , [4]  in the second year as a  Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow . In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical  binary multiplier . [60]  In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the  Department of Mathematics  at Princeton; [61]  his dissertation,  Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals , [62] [63]  introduced the concept of  ordinal logic  and the notion of  relative computing , in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called  oracles , allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his  postdoctoral assistant , but he went back to the United Kingdom. [64]

B. Braithwaite for the thesis 'Argument and Proof'; [3] he was an early pioneer in meaning-based approaches to the understanding of natural language content by computers. [4] His main early contribution in the 1970s was called "Preference Semantics" (Wilks, 1973; Wilks and Fass, 1992), an algorithmic method for assigning the "most coherent" interpretation to a sentence in terms of having the maximum number of internal preferences of its parts (normally verbs or adjectives) satisfied. That early work was hand-coded with semantic entries (of the order of some hundreds) as was normal at the time, but since then has led to the empirical determinations of preferences (chiefly of English verbs) in the 1980s and 1990s.

Surname: Winograd
Awards: 5
Education: Winograd grew up in Colorado and graduated from  Colorado College  in 1966. He wrote  SHRDLU  as a PhD thesis at  MIT  in the years from 1968–70. In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient "understanding" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a  blocks world , restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated "world of toy blocks". The program could accept commands such as, "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, "I do not know which block you mean." The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or "brittle" such programs are.

Surname: Zadeh
Awards: 4
Education: Zadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963. One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science. He initiated and completed (in 1968) the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley's advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments. 
In 1973, Lotfi Zadeh received the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS. Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships: Academic Planning & Resource Allocation (1992–95); Committees (1969–70; 1980–81); Courses of Instruction (1975–80); and Faculty Awards (1990–92). Professor Zadeh graduated more than 50 PhD students, many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering, management and information sciences. [30]
